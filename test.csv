1,Positive,One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play,"Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it."
2,Negative,Batteries died within a year ...,"I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power."
3,Positive,"works fine, but Maha Energy is better","Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries."
4,Positive,Great for the non-audiophile,"Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote."
5,Negative,DVD Player crapped out after one year,"I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot."
6,Negative,Incorrect Disc,"I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it."
7,Negative,DVD menu select problems,"I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
8,Positive,Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's,"Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. ""Dr Shen Fu"", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous."
9,Negative,"Not an ""ultimate guide""","Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you."
10,Positive,Great book for travelling Europe,"I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go, and once you are there."
11,Negative,Not!,"If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated."
12,Negative,A complete Bust,"This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions."
13,Positive,TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!,I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
14,Negative,didn't run off of USB bus power,"Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back."
15,Negative,Don't buy!,"First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!"
16,Positive,"Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages","This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too."
17,Positive,Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers,"For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade."
18,Positive,SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX,"Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas, lo puedes usar como obra de consultaNos trae LAS HISTORIA DE LOS BOXEADORES MÁS BRILLANTES, DE LOS CAMPEONES DURANTE CIEN AÑOS !!Si te gusta el box...¡NO TE LO PIERDAS !"
19,Positive,Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time,This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
20,Negative,Long and boring,"I've read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all through out the book"
21,Negative,Dont like it,This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
22,Positive,one of the last in the series to collect !,The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
23,Positive,Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD,"I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation."
24,Negative,Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable,"If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for."
25,Negative,Waste of money!,"Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done."
26,Positive,works great,"i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed, but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this. just too many variables. I can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage; at least 40' going thru two buildings. now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know."
27,Negative,Has No Range,"I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
28,Positive,wish i had gotten this sooner!,"ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk, shelf, etc."
29,Negative,Three Days of Use and It Broke,"Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
30,Positive,This is the all time best book!,"This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world."
31,Positive,Mary Ash,Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
32,Positive,Tha BOMB of a book!!,"L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!"
33,Positive,This book was a great book that i have read many times!,This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story because I want to know if Mary-Lynette and Ash get together.
34,Positive,They'd watch it nonstop if I'd let them,"apart from it arriving broken the first time, my kids are loving this DVD, which I alternate with the other I purchased to keep my own sanity. This DVD has created a Thomas fan out of my 3 1/2 yr. old daughter as well."
35,Negative,Not as expected...,My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
36,Positive,Wonderful,I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
37,Negative,Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered,"Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again."
38,Positive,Book of Chance,"I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed."
39,Negative,"Light reading, light in substance","A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up."
40,Positive,WeiB FOREVER!,"This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that ""hunt the tomorrow"" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see..."
41,Negative,Great Book--unacceptable condition,"I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund."
42,Positive,Real HTML for people who build sites for a living,"This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away."
43,Positive,Marriage has its good and bad moments,"This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix), plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts. It ends the way a typical relationship of this type would, but that's not exactly a bad thing in this case. I recommend it to everyone."
44,Positive,Amazing...,love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
45,Positive,Leslie in a nutshell,"Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal, is an amazing little pedal!I use it with guitar, and keyboards.Using with Keyboards, organ mode(doesn't matter which type) jazz, rock, gives me an instant controllable Leslie effects.it includes fast and slow ramp up,boost, volume/drive. thru a mixer in stereo you can do some amazing stuff with this inexpensive unit.The only drawback i have found is the buttons are very hard to engage and disengage.But i'm working on that. i will modify the springs if possible and maybe even send a recommendation to Danelectro."
46,Negative,More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!,"the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the ""dark"" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!"
47,Negative,A Lost Author,"I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame."
48,Negative,Okay but Messy....,"We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes."
49,Positive,Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader,"I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series."
50,Positive,Best of the First Four in this series.,"This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always ""one against the world"", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment."
51,Positive,Great Beginning...poor ending,"Parricia Corwell, Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning! Her relation to her family, her dedication to her work exeptional. However, this story began to get boring towards the end...the ending, not too great."
52,Negative,12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make....,"Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell, I have heard many more clever jokes and ""one-liners"" watching King of Queens on cable.....SERIOUSLY FOLKS, it's THAT BAD....the bad jokes and the 23 references to small jewish penises got old real quick. Thought i would always be a Sandler fan but he clearly, Adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and RAN!Why else would the plot line include Seth Rogan writing for him??? To put things into perspective, this film made Bruno look like Casablanca!!"
53,Negative,I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this.,"I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude ""jokes"". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing."
54,Positive,"Wonderful, baffling mix","This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird"
55,Positive,No another grill like this...,This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
56,Negative,Disappointment at it's extreme,"I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author."
57,Positive,From Potter's Field by Patricia Cornwell.,This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
58,Positive,An Engrossing and Chilling Read,"My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the ""evil"" Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give ""gifts"" to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say, I will be reading more of Cornwell's books, especially if they are at all like this novel."
59,Positive,"great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie, where is it?",the publisher said soon to be a movie. does anyone know if a movie was ever created?
60,Positive,Simply Awesome!,This was only my first Cornwell novel and I'm hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can't wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.
61,Negative,Predictable & has a lame ending,"I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel."
62,Positive,Black Knight C2C Heat Squash Racquet,"Great racquet! But I'm a power hitter I have no power Generating Difficulty With This racquet. My style is to try to volleyball and everything I've found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered. I like the factory grip although with distinct ridges Others prefer a smooth grip May - give the factory grip on chance and you May Come to like it. The ""sale"" prices are right for a high About end racquet, racquets and Black Knight in Have a reputation for overall durability so you Should get plenty of use Before replacement. Note: I got my first C2C as a D level player and did not like it Immediately. Howeve, as my game improved version I switched from my Bandit Black Knight C2C White racquet to the great success and Have HAD. So, It Might not be the right racquet for a beginner, intermediate to advanced players But Will Benefit From this fine racquet."
63,Negative,A historical gem whose title obscures its intent,Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
64,Negative,Vastly overrated work of fiction,"I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure, back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. On the other hand, meteorologists seem to do quite well.Naturally the radical libertarians, tea-baggers & Republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence. I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty & irrational."
65,Positive,sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band,"edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky, secluded,isolating tunes. i envision a ironical pace. i thought she was from chicago, millions and millions of people, and she sings stark loneliness"
66,Positive,Great Camera,I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
67,Negative,Had to return it,"The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy, just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn't feel smooth all over. Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage. If you do decide to purchase this product it's easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts."
68,Negative,"Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then","I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved."
69,Positive,The amazing squeem,"I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture, you eat much less since it squeezes the he'll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze."
70,Positive,Great Product,"A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core, which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy."
71,Positive,I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.,"I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6, I'm 5'4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6"" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last."
72,Negative,WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through,"The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it."
73,Negative,CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG,"I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!"
74,Negative,Not happy,I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.
75,Negative,nice product,My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
76,Positive,Does the job,"I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect."
77,Negative,conspiracy theorist,"The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot's mind actually works."
78,Negative,Another disappointment from Higgins,"This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger, don't waste your money. The cover price of .....is an insult and the deeply discounted .......... price will still leave you feeling ripped-off. Go to your local library in the morning and you'll finish Edge of Danger in time for an early lunch. Just don't expect to have any appetite left."
79,Negative,"1, and thats being generous....","I have read many of Jack Higgins' books and this is the poorest so far, in my humble belief. As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read""To Tess, who thinks it's about time""Author, I think she may mean something else...."
80,Positive,Good matt nude lipstick,It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
81,Positive,I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent,West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
82,Positive,A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe,"A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other ""Woman against the odds"" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's ""Shelters of Stone""."
83,Negative,where does the Novel begin?,I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
84,Negative,Avoid it.,"The abridged version of this book would read as so:""Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong.""There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it."
85,Negative,ok...,this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
86,Positive,The Scarlet Letter,I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
87,Negative,This edition is not complete,"This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, ""The Custom-House."" Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition."
88,Positive,Creepy,The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol
89,Negative,A book for those with time on their hands,"If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point."
90,Negative,Painful,"This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"
91,Positive,Great novel,"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans."
92,Negative,Horrible reader,i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
93,Negative,Mistake?,"I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again."
94,Positive,"The ""Scarlet"" Letter","Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear."
95,Positive,The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American,"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."
96,Negative,The Scarlet Letter: A soap opera,"Although this book, is considered a great work of literature, written to describe the harshness of Purtian New England. Plus, this book was heavily laiden with symbolism, and many other literary tools.The scarlet letter is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. Not only is it boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. This boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages. This is a good book to study, however it is not a good book to read for pleasure, under any circumstance!!"
97,Positive,This book is Great!,"One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter, I disagree. It's no wonder that people that don't know how to capitalize the word 'I'. I thought that this book was wonderful, if you are willing to put effort into understanding it."
98,Negative,I had to read it...,I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
99,Positive,Possibly the funniest movie ever made.,"It starts off a bit slow, but once the product placement jokes start it takes off."
100,Negative,same problems as munchkin version,"Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin"
101,Positive,Sassy Baby Warming Dish. Interesting concept.,"We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small, and didn't really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant, although I think a blanket would work just as well.Recommendation:Buy********************HoldSell"
102,Negative,Unreadable!,"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
103,Negative,Used for circuits project,"I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment."
104,Negative,Two Tedious Hours,"The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids."
105,Negative,one of the worst movies of 2002,"god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider and others contribute voices."
106,Positive,Fantastic,"A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie."
107,Negative,very disappointing,"The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all."
108,Negative,Sandler Strikes Out,"8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running."
109,Negative,"Not the worst, but far from good","This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book ""The 50 worst films of all time"". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!"
110,Negative,Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?,"I have, too, but this isn't it. The translation is very choppy, the singers are medicore at best, and the orchestrations are too overwhelming. ""Love Changes Everything"" is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to it.Oddly, the best song is the French ""Chanson d'Enfance.""I was very surprised, as the Japanese usually put out extramely good cast CDS. Their CATS and Phantom and the Tokoyo Evita are all great. But unless you are a total ALW or AOL fanatic, save your money."
111,Positive,"It Rises above the ""Fluff"" Books","The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on ""emotional states"" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic."
112,Positive,Itten The Elements of Color,"I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition, rather than very good. I would like to thank the person who made it possible, but have misplaced her name and address."
113,Positive,great IMO,"First of all, I saw the review by ""Tyley Mike ""Relite"""" and thought he was grossly overcritical of EVERYTHING and every instrument played... so I'd like to hear Tyley Mike's album, since he thinks he can do better :) --seriously! I think some people don't understand that things sound the way they were MEANT to sound, if they sound poppy, they made it that way, why the hell should they stick to the norm? They want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great.I can't write a good enough review for this album, all their albums actually, as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting. It bugs me when a group doesn't evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were, all the time, so I was glad to see them progress and ""grow"".There's too much to say to describe this album, but frankly I don't think I could write a good enough review to do it justice, so I'll just give it my 5 stars :)"
114,Positive,I wish...,...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...
115,Positive,Good follow-up to El Cielo.,"A bit of a change this time for Dredg, less progressive material, more straight ahead rock tunes. I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn't have alot of stuff going on like with El Cielo which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms. But still this is the direction they chose to go in and it's definitely a very good one."
116,Negative,WOW!,"This book really bothers me. If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability, do not read this book. It does not offer any advice for parents, just helps fuel negativitiy. Please do not put yourself through reading this book. If you are still in the grieving stage, this book will not help you. As parents, please try surrounding yourself with positives. Children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life. They can help you learn, help you become more empathetic, help you become stronger, and bring wonderful caring people into your life. Please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life. Do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration, anger, sadness, and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives."
117,Positive,80s Hard Rock,One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!! It's pity that they are almost retiring soon...
118,Negative,Low class effort by High Class Band,"This material represents why the 80's died, the music is bland and poppy, the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten."
119,Positive,Good Quality Cell Phone Holder,"Contrary to other review, I found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever."
120,Positive,Loved it!,I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
121,Positive,Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!,I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!
122,Positive,There is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review....,"This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn't like Vince Guardaldi's jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn't air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it."
123,Positive,"I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! ""They don't know entertainment"" as Krusty would say","I do love ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"", a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"" had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!"
124,Positive,Charlie Brown Christmas,One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
125,Positive,Proof that good things are built to last,"When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - ""Sparky"" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season."
126,Positive,great Christmas gift,This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
127,Positive,Yahoo for Charlie Brown,Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
128,Positive,The Best Present Of All,"My children are a little old (age-wise) for this, but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year. This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come.Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special. I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday. Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic. This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus' delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children. This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection."
129,Positive,Classic,"Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself, with her as well as with my hubby. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!"
130,Negative,Not a real Rammstein album.,"Bootleg collection of b-sides, remixes, and singles. Really, why even bother?"
131,Negative,After a few months- broken,"This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality."
132,Positive,"Works great, and half the price","This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15"" Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad, it was a nice touch)."
133,Positive,This is a good product!,"When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn't sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4"
134,Positive,Quite Satisfactory,"This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. Also doesn't have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original, but once again, that's a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase."
135,Positive,Great product at a great price,"A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended."
136,Positive,Excellent Item!,"I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT, and cool bluish color. The cable that breaks on Apple's charger is noticeably thicker on this charger.Get this. You'll not regret it."
137,Negative,Off and on,Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
138,Negative,"Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord","This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
139,Positive,So much better than the apple version!,"I love it, it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot! It's wonderful!"
140,Positive,Good product at reasonable price,"Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply, it seems to work fine--and it is very reasonably priced. Too bad that Amazon stopped carrying the supply."
141,Negative,If you're tempted to throw away $30....,"I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14""). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead."
142,Negative,Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4,"This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned."
143,Negative,Stopped Working Day 3,"Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear."
144,Positive,Another Binchy Great,"This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding."
145,Positive,TU VIDA JAMAS VOLVERA A SER LA MISMA,"Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente, todo tiene sentido y gracias a estos conocimientos he podido ayudar a otras seres a vivir su vida con un proposito que es ser mejores cada dia para pasar de nivel en nuestro crecimiento espiritual; este libro no es para aquellas personas que le tienen miedo a la verdad; pero si te atrevez a leerlo te aseguro que tu vida jamas volvera a ser la misma.ATREVETE!!!"
146,Positive,Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization,"I will say that the concept this book adds of ""playing with future"" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull"
147,Negative,"book only, no jacks",I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!
148,Positive,Thomas connector tracks,The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
149,Negative,Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish,"This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though ""O please get over yourself"". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time."
150,Negative,Disturbing.,"If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else."
151,Negative,Not Very good,"I dont advise buying this grider, it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper."
152,Negative,Cannot adjust for coarseness,"The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing."
153,Positive,Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark,"Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short."
154,Positive,My Girl Likes It,"My two and half years old girl likes it so much, and every I want to allure her to bed to sleep, I will say read I Spy in bed."
155,Positive,Still a great book,"The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception, but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would of gave it a 5 if I had not read the others."
156,Negative,I could have spent my money better,This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
157,Positive,Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies,"Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtail.Children are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start."
158,Positive,Climalite works as intended,"More visually interesting than plain white, and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton. But please don't wear them with sandals, they aren't that visually interesting!The bottom black part is thicker, but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use...you know what I mean...thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear.The uppers, the white and colored part are thin, stretchy and breathable, flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no-shows if you choose."
159,Positive,A Man of Reason,"At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea ""Individual Rights"" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that ""we have it in our power to make the world over again"", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing ""We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way"". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!"
160,Positive,I was there,I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.
161,Positive,Course Book,Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
162,Positive,Leadership Made Spiritual,Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
163,Positive,Absolutely incredible,"I was so happy with Dolly's ""Hungry Again,"" and her return to real country. I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind), makes an entire album of great music, instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music, I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash's ""I Still Miss Someone"" gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely ""Will He Be Waiting For Me."" This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn't be happier. I'm 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren't just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word."
164,Positive,Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!,"As a child, I grew up in Knoxville, TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm & Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn't really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately, she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean, I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.) Dolly's gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the Grammy's with The Grass is Blue and Trio II. A Top 10 CD if I ever heard one!"
165,Negative,Band saves CD,"As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work."
166,Positive,Almost perfect CD,"The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!"
167,Positive,The Castle in the Attic,I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
168,Positive,non stop adventure,"This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him, you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure!!!"
169,Negative,worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
170,Positive,One of my favorites as a kid,"I loved this book when I was about eight years old, and looking back on it, it's easy to see why: William, the main character, is a gymnast (just as I was) who's rather shy and reserved (just as I was) but manages, when it's important, to help the people around him. He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn't hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults. I have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed-time reading."
171,Positive,excellent,"Good price, excellent design and shipped well.Would've been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving."
172,Positive,Best witch book i've ever read!!!,"Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
173,Negative,Maybe next time...,"I, like a lot of people writing reviews, play a lot of first person shooters. If you liked Splinter Cell, buy TRAOD USED!!! I agree with everyone here...story is good, controls are less than mediocre. Even Enter the Matrix blew this game away. Customizing the keyboard helps some, but less than what I expected. I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS, but to no avail. Hopefully, if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer. And for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc, I can assure you that is NOT the case."
174,Positive,To many issues,"The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game."
175,Negative,Lara should have remained in the tomb,"I was so looking forward to this game being released, I was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date. Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it's release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven't felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game, which is what games are all about. Sorry Core and Eidos, this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well. What a boost this could have been for you."
176,Negative,Angel of darkness is correct,This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
177,Negative,"Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book","This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!"
178,Positive,this will interest children in insects,"This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout, with many beautiful photographs (if insects can be called beautiful). The text, mixed nicely with the pictures, covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts."
179,Negative,"Good, but only to the midway point","This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
180,Negative,a terrible product,"this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS."
181,Negative,BUYER BEWARE,This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
182,Negative,Didactic melodrama,"I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended."
183,Negative,"Well, not everything","It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of ""real life"" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a ""good enough"" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting."
184,Negative,Software is Horrible!,This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
185,Negative,Biography of Wright and his works,"Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view."
186,Positive,The Top Ten List for Christians byJames W. Moore,"A bit simplistic at times, but got some good discussions goingin our Sunday School class (Methodist). Would recommend itfor Contemporary Adult Sunday School classes or Bible studies."
187,Positive,Live it,"Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome, so has a good seal to it."
188,Negative,elem diff e-q's,"While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading."
189,Positive,This is really cool!,This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!
190,Negative,Very Disappointing.,"I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past."
191,Positive,A carefully constructed read.,"This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's ""How to get control of time and your life"", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background."
192,Negative,Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?,"I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!"
193,Positive,Almost perfect,"Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch, so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more."
194,Negative,Not Stainless,"These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8"" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for."
195,Positive,"The meaning of God, the meaning of life.","Both of these issues, among others, are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters, all of whom we recognize.What lies beneath the skin of the average person? What do they believe in, and why? What makes their worlds shatter? What would make your world shatter?The author never wastes a word, entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways. It's a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world. This makes the book touching on a personal level. I think every reader will find a different way, and reason, to love this book."
196,Negative,What a disappointment!,"I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future."
197,Negative,You get what you pay for.,"I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now."
198,Negative,junk!,Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
199,Positive,fireplace tool set,Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
200,Negative,Failed to Work,I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
201,Positive,Long Hot Summer,"Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river, two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots, you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia."
202,Negative,Mathematical nonsense,"Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice."
203,Negative,Boring ...,"I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time."
204,Negative,Stuck With You,"I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book, there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex."
205,Positive,None,"Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed, smiled, and even got tears! A brand new favorite author."
206,Positive,Witty and clever.,"This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included, just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan."
207,Positive,Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry,"Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted, anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs. Although there are no spontanious songs on this one, his CDs from his independent labels are loaded with them. He has a talent for ushering believers into God's presence.The songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics. This is a must have. This CD is out of print and if you can get your hands on one - do it quickly!"
208,Negative,"lousy, outdated guide, with horrible printing flaws!","First thing I noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together. No, really...they were. The printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book. There were many pages that had to be hand cut just to TURN them. I could not stand the ... design. Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications.MIGHT be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually READ them."
209,Negative,Still yet to recieve,I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I've tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!
210,Positive,Big things in small package,"When I purchased this small hardcover book, I didn't expect very much. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.LBW is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship.This is a must read that is well-written and culturally enlightening."
211,Negative,broken :(,The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
212,Negative,Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF,"The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the ""ON"" button, but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the ""OFF"" to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons, to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement), but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent, reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer."
213,Negative,Left me feeling wanting.........,"Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it. He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines?"
214,Positive,Gun Digest 1911 Review,This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Excellent tutorial and very entertaining. The detailed discriptions and the pictures were informative. I spoke with the recipient of the gift after Christmas and he agreed. I really appreciate Amazon's speedy service.
215,Negative,THIS CD SUCKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE, AND IT REALLY SUCKED!!!!! IF SOMEONE IS ITNERESTED IN BUYING THIS, DON'T, IT'S A WATSE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
216,Positive,Nice but Sony must give us more info,"This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information"
217,Positive,LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion,"This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing."
218,Positive,CUT IT UP DEF,IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
219,Negative,I do not recommend this vacuum,"We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
220,Negative,More Fiction than fact,"Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of ""Billy the Kid"" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy."
221,Negative,waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Squiggler fell apart at second use, with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard, horribly designed and made product!!!!!"
222,Positive,CO alarm,Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.j.
223,Positive,Easy as it can be.,"I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all, but she had no trouble with setting this up. She's completely happy, California is happy, and I'm happy."
224,Negative,THE ROCKETS RED GLARE ???,"This over-priced pain in ""the sitting area"" has an always-on, glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don't have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug."
225,Positive,Absolutely great tripod for movie camera,"excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of ""shaky"" movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price"
226,Positive,A written masterpiece,"I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible, this book is a masterpiece unparalleled."
227,Negative,"Love Jerry and Dean, just not this version","I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film, however, the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally, it wasn't listed as a DVD-R, but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection."
228,Negative,"Crap, Junk, Worthless, etc","The other 1-star poster is absolutely correct; these things are crap. I ordered two of them for both my kids and neither worked at all. The rockets didn't seal on the pump so no pressure could be pumped into them, thus making them useless. I had high hopes for this toy because of my love for it when I was younger. As always, the quality of these ""nostalgic"" toys leave much to be desired (I'm looking at you, Evel Knievel Dare Devil Stunt Set!). The price is cheap, but the quality is cheaper."
229,Positive,Dense with knowledge,"This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles."
230,Positive,I'd give it 6+ stars if I could!,"The cover blurb on this book says it all: ""For office slaves, Internet addicts and stressed-out students."" (ha! I am all three) If you are like me and have looked at many a Yoga book but put them aside due to the difficult positions/instructions or the time involved, but still want to feel better, relax and also rejuivinate, AS well as relieve the symptoms of the computer age, then this is the book for you. A definate must-buy!"
231,Positive,An American Treasure,Charles Brown is an American treasure. His blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals. The selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that CB has produced his entire life. Buy this cd. Buy any cd by Charles Brown. You won't regret it.
232,Negative,not finding comfort in food,"I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However, this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self-confidence. It is not true, obviously. I am not overweight and never had any eating disorders, but I just don't have a positive self-image. So if you're like me, don't read this book. I couldn't relate to it. The title is misleading."
233,Positive,"Typical Thomas video, all about James",THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James's brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn't have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn't realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.
234,Negative,Inexpensive but poor quality,"The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand ""new"" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can't imagine using them for metal, let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price, I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons."
235,Negative,Dull and dirty,Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
236,Positive,Deserving of the Pulitzer it won; but don't be scared by it.,"Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them. This book also gives the reader an understanding of the world in which they grew up. A world where Stalin was (literally) God. A world without independent thought. Fascinating, heart wrenching. Very readable."
237,Positive,Like this by Technotronic featuring Monday Midnite,"Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70's by using a sample of the classic ""clean up the ghetto"". Monday Midnite's freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus, the song keeps you dancing till the last beat. Love it."
238,Negative,A Disappointing Misrepresentation,"Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter, Dorie Greenspan I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [i.e., only 8 shows from this far more extensive series] selection of the books recipes. What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is ""Buyer beware"""
239,Positive,A peek inside the process.,"First thing's first, ""Homespun"" is an album of demos for ""Apple Venus"". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, ""Skylarking"" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for ""Apple Venus"". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places (""Frivolous Tonight"") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts ""River of Orchids"" and ""Green Man"".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (""Knights in Shining Karma""), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out ""Apple Venus"", it's a fine record."
240,Positive,As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.,"I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."
241,Positive,a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories,"I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read."
242,Negative,Do Not Buy This Software!,"I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software..."
243,Positive,Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray],"This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!"
244,Positive,Awesome,This movie was awesome! The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.
245,Positive,I am so glad I found this!,"At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found ""Quaker Oat Bran"" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too."
246,Positive,Excellent.....REALLY,"Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I'd just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. Just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place.It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up.EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT."
247,Positive,Its a cable,"Its a cable, it works, what else do you want? I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says ""sony"" on it. Yea!! But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for. Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market. who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products."
248,Positive,awesome book to explain death to children,The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
249,Positive,I'm grateful for this book,"We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime, which I found slightly surprising."
250,Positive,Effective book for discussing physical death with a child,"As a public school librarian, I would say that ""Lifetimes"" is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: ""Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever."" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that ""Lifetimes"" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system."
251,Positive,Great band even better now,"Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music.When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice.These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare.The music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.Tell Me, I lost everything today,The only one, and got me going are some of the ones that stand out to me.The cover of the Police's ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" is one of the more interesting covers I have ever heard.If you liked ""From One"" the buy this disc. I would love to see these guy live."
252,Negative,USA1,Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today?? No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions?? Are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have PHD behind their name? The other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works. I'm sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college. Not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth.
253,Positive,Worst Night World book,"This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero[Thierry is the best]. He is stupid[he cheated on the SATs].If you haven't read any of the Night World books, don't start with this one."
254,Negative,This book is messed up,"In this book, not only is there no real ""love"" scenes, but to top it off, the girl's cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate. Granted, Angel is dead, but he's still related to her and definately should NOT be trying to catch his own cousin. Ewww. To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a 'coming of age' story about how being popluar isn't the most important. I love every other Night World book, but this is retarded."
255,Positive,Impressive,"One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD."
256,Positive,The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity,This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...
257,Negative,Not What I'd Hoped For,"I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises ""hick"" UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel's trust-me-I- know-what-I'm-talking-about theories and explanations. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men (in black) behaving badly. With little to recommend it (and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings, there's no other recommendation), ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a considerable disappointment."
258,Negative,SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!,"Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead."
259,Negative,And the point was...?,"Although I prefer books with an actual plot, I don't mind reading choppy, journal-type entries if there is actually a point to all of it, or if at least such entries are entertaining. This book's are, albeit only in the beginning. After a while you'll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that's just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn't worth the time--or the title. There's hardly anything about ""the mothman"" in it."
260,Negative,Mothman proficies ?,"257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70's UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else."
261,Negative,Never Before.......,"Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this, oh man was I disappointed.I thought it would be an intelligent well written peice on the mothman mystery. I don't know what this was. Holy mackeral. i've never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book. Just crazy!Just a few of my favourites:"" so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms. The child began to cry, more insulted than hurt."" what!? I'm thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted. This Keel dude is too much....Talking about this ""mysterious"" guy Tiny who a witness said saw a wire running up his pant leg. and i quote"" was tiny wearing electric socks? or was he a wired android operated by remote control.""what???! pretty much where I stopped before my mind turned to mush"
262,Negative,Are you joking?,"I'm giving it one star because less isn't possible here.You people _do_ realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction, right? There is and can be no truth behind them whatsoever: no science, no documentary or physical evidence, nothing! There are no MIBs (except in the movies), no secret ""conspiracies"" to hide evidence of alien visitations, no alien abductions,... absolutely none of this book or any of its kind are true.Ask yourselves: If this is really true, then why, with our government so unable to keep secrets about presidential peccadillos, financial scandals, politcal dirty tricks, payoffs, espionage and intelligence screwups and the like, how any ""conspiracy"" of this magnitude escaped detection and revelation?It simply makes no sense. It is pure entertainment, nothing more.And you Five-Star reviewers have credit cards....?"
263,Negative,fine if you support terrorism,"I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-""Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop"" [reffering to LTTE snipers]""Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop""She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they're buying here."
264,Positive,"Good for afterwork cruising, better for airplane tranquility","Listening to this cd, I turned my car stereo all the way up, on my way back from work. The lyric is very ostentatious and the beats are showy. 10 dollars and Hombre are two of my favorite tracks, they are both clever yet funny. It does have a political overtone, but it's ok, I like the revolution type mood. It's actually very good stuff when you are on a plane, totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat, and you can imagine a party in your head."
265,Negative,What's the big deal?,"The only thing interesting about this album is mia's accent. Seriously, the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clichéd. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music."
266,Positive,Excellant,"I love Kala as well, because it sounds cleaner and more developed. However this album was an excellant break out in her career. fire, fire is one of my favorites. Mix with marijuana."
267,Positive,"So Original, So Fun","A friend introduced me to this CD and it's quickly become a favourite. M.I.A.'s music so catchy and so fun to dance to, yet it's also lasting...I've been listening to it over and over. And I love the fact that she brings an ethnic vibe into her music."
268,Negative,noritake colorwave stoneware,"I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time."
269,Positive,A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway.,"Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's."
270,Positive,Old age gold...,"As a 27 year old man from the UK, I was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time (which was quite frankly, before my time). I love it and hope you do too.Thanks, OC."
271,Negative,Tiene que ser sensilla!!,"Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama, talento, y bellesa que esta mujer tiene? No tiene voz suave, ni fuerte. Deveria dedicarse a otra cosa. Lo que sea.. menos cantar, y actuar porque seria igual de ridicula que Patty Navidad!! Este es uno de los peores Discos que he escuchado en toda mi vida!!"
272,Negative,Repetitive and monotone,"I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."
273,Negative,Worst book I've ever read,"This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I ""attempted"" to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade."
274,Positive,Frankenstein Continued??,"When I first heard about this book, I wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation. Fortunately, a continuation.I had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock, I bought it. I read it in 4 days, reading each night after work. I can say it was a good read. Steady flowing action, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc. I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt. But, never fear, there is to be 3 more books before the real ending. So, we all have something to look forward to.This is only the second Koontz book I have read, so I was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing. More die hard Koontz fans may be able to tell the difference.So, overall a good, smooth, never dull, read. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist."
275,Negative,Fine until it started eating tapes,"Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous ""Remove cassette"" message and is mangling tapes. I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for ""canon zr users group"" and ""eating tapes"" to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders."
276,Negative,My [Goodness]!!!!,"world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire, 4 dv's, and a carrying caseIt is honestly the worst, disgusting, and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw [your money]into the atlantic oceanDO NOT GET THIS EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT. RETURN IT. GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!"
277,Positive,"Lots of effects, lightweight & easy to use.","Awesome Camcorder & Camera functions in this lightweight, easy to use camcorder make it a breeze to shoot great memories for a novice like me, right out of the box. This camcorder also has a huge selection of special effects, and options to make really interesting video effects. I love this camcorder!"
278,Positive,excellent book for the novice improviser to the instructor,"Izzy does a great job of making the format of the book simple yet engaging. His explaination of the games with goals, group size, time, process and variations for each of the games is very helpful. It is written so that a sales team leader could pick it up and have some great games to get his/her team thinking creatively, working on teamwork and self confidence. My only complaint as a past performer and current instructor is that it isn't long enough. Write another."
279,Positive,hard -to-find tension rods,"Our living room has a ""bow"" window with five narrow panels. I looked many places for narrow-but-strong tension rods. I was pleased to find these and to get free shipping. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you."
280,Positive,"YES, YES, YES great read","Love the book..I was born 250 years too late..I would have liked to been there at the time...HOWEVER, massacre does not sound like it feels good ! lol"
281,Positive,A MUST HAVE!,I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.
282,Positive,Paradise kiss rocks!!!!,"OMG!! thats all i can say.its just sooo fabulous!!! when i first heard about it i was contridicting weather or not i should read it but then i decided ,""hey why not?"" now that i read this fab manga,theres no turning back!!!this is totally a keeper! i strongly recomend!!!!"
283,Negative,If you are a Nirvana fan this album is not for you.,"I am a huge Nirvana fan I have been one ever since 1990 when I first listened to Bleach. If you are die hard like me you will not like this album, you probably already have all the songs on this album so don't waste your money. The only reason I would recommend someone to but this album is if they did not buy the box set. I wish I had my $10.00 back."
284,Negative,Ehh,The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.
285,Negative,True Nirvana sucks,"I'll tell you what's REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are ""illegal"". Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is ""true"" Nirvana, then ""true"" Nirvana sucks."
286,Negative,garbage,"Complete garbage, the sound quality is horrible, if your going to release a best of cd, record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag."
287,Negative,Not what I expected,I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing.
288,Positive,Love these glasses,"I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color, but I'm wanting matching in a smaller glass and can't seem to find the same color. Anyway, I really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier. Also, these glasses are very stable, don't tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don't slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these."
289,Positive,Forsyte Saga - a well awarded but oft forgotten classic,"I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader, but usually I don't enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more ""Adventure! Action!"" type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!"
290,Negative,The book is great but the edition is an embarrasment,"... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word ""ficbe"" came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don't they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition."
291,Negative,Expensive experiment that didn't work,"I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done."
292,Negative,Lame Jujitsuka,"I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised."
293,Negative,Small type,"My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose."
294,Positive,Takes Tree-hugging to a New Level (Third),"In the forest of Midworld, one had better learn to hug close to one's home tree or risk being killed by innumerable plants, animals, insects, and other beings less well categorized.Yet, despite a living space defined by various levels of Hell below and above, this planet accommodates a small group of humans who succeeded in adapting to its rigors. Ironically, the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clear-cut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greed,Alan Dean Foster is one of my favorite authors - though I remain envious of his imagination, writing skills, and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself. As much as possible on this planet, he's experienced much of the action he describes in his fiction."
295,Positive,Best Alan Dean Foster book!,"I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen, and it had me hooked on SF.Alan Dean has let me down time and time again since, but this book is a classic.You MUST read this one. It'll be fun, and you won't be able to put it down.After finishing this one, try hunting down ""Dark Star"", a movie-novelization that is almost as good as ""Midworld""."
296,Negative,Plain Putrid,"This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak."
297,Negative,Can I shoot myself now??,"A few years back I was forced to read ""Tess"" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on ""Tess.."""
298,Negative,Awful,This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.
299,Negative,Cruel and Depressing Story,Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
300,Negative,"The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals.","Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."
301,Positive,Obligatory,My kindle is making me do this...One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
302,Positive,Good Companion Piece,I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
303,Positive,Great classic,"I remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again. I had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following Tess through her trials and tribulations, albeit some self imposed."
304,Positive,"Beautifully written, dark Masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl.","A beautifully written, dark masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl. Her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor, unable to fulfill his obligations. Tess takes his place and, through a series of misfortunes, is sent away to rich 'relatives' with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family. She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again. It's a beautiful love story, and so much more. Highly recommended!"
305,Negative,I hated this book then....,"...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that's done."
306,Negative,Bad purchace.,"Well I thought I was getting the student edition, but I got the Instructor's edition. I guess I'll have to go back to B&N."
307,Negative,Ummm,I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
308,Positive,Science Fact Empowers Science Fiction,"Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the ""manned mission to Mars"" genre."
309,Positive,Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable,"In an Age of Communist Oppression, we see a side of Daniel Day-Lewis reminiscent of the lovable letch 'Newland' in The Age of Innocence. Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It's amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas' wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it's Tomas' decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie."
310,Negative,Please read Kundera's book instead,"Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."""
311,Positive,Sad Yet Beautiful,"The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film, but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine, who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate, and cannot change her feelings. This film explores the difference between the two, and the pain that one causes the other by his ""lightness of being"".Towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker, so be ready to cry your eyes out."
312,Positive,Milan Kundera rides again...,"A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book, too. Not for the shallow-minded."
313,Negative,Lacking,The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
314,Negative,The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite (End Spoiler),"Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident."
315,Negative,disappointed,"I have been very impressed by other ""pickin on"" music: Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zep, Santana, to name a few I have. However, Hendrix music did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style, it was a great disappointment, and this is one CD I will get rid of quickly."
316,Positive,The birth of Drone??,"As far as I know,this predates anything else known as ""drone"" music,which seems to be a popular genre these days.This is about as psychedelic as it gets,your mind wandering out into the infinite void.So good."
317,Positive,Short stories with a message,"Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples' private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life, something drastic can happen and change your world around. The stories are touching, yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of life.I would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life."
318,Positive,Fantastic products - great way to try them all!,"I try everything new, hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes (and I'm only 36!) --Anyway, when I read about rice bran, I thought why not - this brand contains a lot of rice bran - it's like the 2nd ingredient in everything after water, and there is nothing else in it I couldn't pronounce. The stuff smells great, and goes on non-greasy, especially the face cream it's like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in. The TrueRenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients, and insturctions (the packages are written in Japanese so you need to read their instructions) - and I even got a free gift of green tea - yum!"
319,Positive,Amazingly soft hair!,"I have been looking for an all natural shampoo, and this is a wonderful one. It made my hair incredibly soft with tons of body--I was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair. The sample is worth the price just to test it out."
320,Positive,Prose-Poetry to inspire,"I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. I read ""On The Road"", ""The Town and The City"", and just before this one, ""The Subterraneans"", which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long ! This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down. If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer."
321,Positive,On the Road To Enlightenment,"Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac's most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective. Lots of meditation, soul searching and existential ruminations about life, truth, and nature. My only regret is that I didn't choose the book format, as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car."
322,Negative,Flat Kerouac,"I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written."
323,Negative,Self Indulgent Nonsense,"The operative word from the title is ""bums"". This is a book about them and their self indulgent, self righteous idleness. A work with no redeeming features."
324,Negative,"Outlines of Theology, AA Hodge: Kindle edition","Very disappointed. The book is a great work, but there are so many unreadable words in the Kindle e-book edition that after a few pages of frustration, you finally give up trying. This product should either be taken off the availablity or corrected for errors so it becomes readable."
325,Positive,Life changing!,This book has changed my life. It opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery. I'm want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.
326,Negative,not worth it,mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
327,Negative,WAIT FOR THE BETTER DVD COMBO!! So dissapointing!,"I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it, and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras!"
328,Negative,Not really a good movie,"This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth."
329,Positive,transformers,The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
330,Positive,Loved It!,I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
331,Positive,Transformers: Dark of the moon,"All I can say is AWESOME, the family loved it and was so very HAPPY to watch and enjoy on a great family evening, Thanks Bunches!"
332,Positive,TRANFORMERS DARK OF THE MOON,transformers dark of the moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation
333,Negative,"1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness","When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd)."
334,Positive,Yeah,"I mean, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one. Came quickly, shipped well, no problems...except the film itself...just....bad."
335,Negative,"Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP!",This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie.
336,Negative,instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d,"I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection."
337,Negative,"Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy?","Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!"
338,Negative,"Great eye candy, but compares poorly to the first one","No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored."
339,Negative,Horrible,Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
340,Negative,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"By most accounts, the Michael Bay-directed Transformers films to date are not very good, but that hasn't stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash, and this third installment, Dark of the Moon, made the most of them all. This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren't exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect to find much more to the movie than ""Ooh, big robots and explosions!"" But hey, for some, that's really all you need."
341,Negative,"The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.","The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck."
342,Negative,"The perfect movie, for a 12 yr old","I gave it one star because the website doesn't allow it to go any lower, and, for all the effort put in by the computer animation team. Other than that, this movie should be negative 1 star.The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth's atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?There's literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things. Besides that, please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra 2 hours of your life."
343,Negative,Lights out on this awful film,"I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as ""immature"" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection."
344,Negative,Not that great,"The first transformers movie will always be the best one, and its just ok. The movies too long jumping back and forth, very poorly constructed."
345,Negative,Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12,"I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description."
346,Positive,Love this movie,Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.
347,Negative,Could have been MUCH better and shorter,"The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie."
348,Positive,Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon,"This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie. It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots. Only beef is that it's language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens. Overall, excellent for adults and recommended."
349,Positive,Transformers Dark of the Moon,A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
350,Negative,"Movie is ok, but..................","the title of the disk pack is totally wrong.It should be Blue Ray + DVD and digital copy available for DLa 210gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it, to me is lame.you enter a very long url, then input the code and start the download managerafter it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie, and get a error 404 website not foundI can get to any other web site I enter, but not to the Transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site cannot be accessed.Paramount should take lessons from Fox on how to include the digital copy"
351,Positive,Guys Movie,"So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there."
352,Negative,Never thought I'd miss Megan Fox!,"I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building. What could possibly go wrong?"
353,Positive,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
354,Negative,Thought transformers suppose to be for kids....,"I know a lot of movies aren't going to be kid friendly. That you will have to fast forward past some things. But Transformers, that advertise a kids theme, sold as toys at stores, can be find in MacDonald happy meals. So you would think the movie be for kids. But it not. They focus more on Sam and love gal then what the robots story. Forget Sam, the name of the movie is TRANSFORMERS.I rate this movie 1star...love the CGI for the robots. But you barley seen the robots. The whole movies is about Sam and his love interest. Michael Bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about TRANSFORMERS...pitiful"
355,Negative,Safety pins,As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
356,Negative,Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler,Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan!
357,Positive,B-Movie-Licious,"I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised, and a little disappointed in my own taste, but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions, Fighting...and that's it. Luckily, it delivers both of those in spades, especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he's a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though."
358,Negative,Hell no.,"Might actually watch this if Cena wasn't in it, if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movie.*Update:Marine II will star Ted Dibease HAHAHAHAHAHAH LOL!!!! pathetic."
359,Negative,"What a complete and utter waste of time, and money.","This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible,the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable,and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy. First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback. No story what so ever. The car chase scene is so full of it, a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around. Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out. Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ...."
360,Negative,Please Listen to Me...Don't buy this product!,"I've had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I'd give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony (who didn't even know what the emarker was) for over four hours, I still can't the thing to work. There's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can't use it at all. If I were you, I'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)As for me, I plan on returning my emarker today."
361,Positive,Sony E-Marker is now obsolete,"Excellent Product, but Sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of Sept so don't bother buying. Shame as it was really good while it lasted."
362,Positive,"good idea, good looks, needs lots of work",I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it's sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.
363,Negative,Totally Useless,"I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless."
364,Negative,worthless,"Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to ""enable"" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work."
365,Negative,Another thingabob on a key chain,"E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain."
366,Negative,Sony has pulled the plug,"Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them."
367,Negative,Worthless,Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
368,Negative,Don't buy this Junk,"Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk."
369,Negative,Artwork???,Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
370,Negative,Absolutely ruined it.,"As a child I would stare at the Gammell's illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid, that I am actually going to write a letter (ON PAPER! with a stamp!!) to Harper Collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person. Jeez. Absolutely terrible, the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this."
371,Negative,I Can Read book has better illustrations,"While the stories in the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, ""In A Dark, Dark Room"", which was written for Level 2 of the ""I Can Read!"" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."""
372,Negative,The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not...,"I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the ""scary"" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator."
373,Negative,Disappointed,"This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to ""freestyle"" and ""improvisation"". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy."
374,Negative,Tongue hurt my ankle,"The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately, the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe. Didn't matter which sock I wore. I had to return."
375,Negative,Buy the 1993 version instead.,"I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author. That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive ""pamphlet"" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere."
376,Positive,Protection Advice,"All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction."
377,Negative,know the source of your information,"While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive."
378,Positive,Great movie and terrific views of the Dingle peninsula.,"We visited the Dingle peninsula of Ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there. Turns out that, in addition to having great scenes of the Dingle countryside, it also has a very good story line. And, terrific acting and some Irish history thrown in for good measure."
379,Positive,Viewed it yesterday,This movie would make a great opera adaptation. Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?
380,Negative,Ryan's Revenge,"A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean."
381,Positive,Excellant movie and seller,"I saw this movie when it first came out, it was hauntingly beautiful. I am so happy to get it on DVD. Some may find it a little slow in areas, but I loved it. If you appreciate the work of David Lean, and the acting of Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum, then you will love this. It ranks right up there for me with Dr. Zhivago, which I also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen. A wonderful epic movie. The seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though I was buying from a friend. Way to do business!!"
382,Negative,it sounds great!~!~!~!~!,it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
383,Positive,It's a very reliable printer...,"I love my PhotoSmart 1215 but was a little discouraged when the driver for XP was not available. The neat thing about this printer is, if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card, you don't have to be connected to your PC. Just know which numbers you want to print, enter and off it goes. The quality of my prints has been great. Right now it's connected to my iMac and is doing splendidly. It's quite dependable and not expensive. I'd recommend it highly.*****"
384,Negative,Grindhouse?,I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.
385,Negative,Am I missing something?,"Sorry about the 1-star rating -- it is not for the book's content (I can't read it), but for the horrible way it displays on my iPad.The cover page is nice and big, fills the screen, and looks great. Ever subsequent page however is about half size, meaning that two pages fit across the iPad screen, and the font is too small to be readable.Furthermore, the iPad version only allows landscape viewing, and the stupid Kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list, and moving on to another book.Am I missing something here?"
386,Positive,Is honesty always rewarded ?,"Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty, terrorism, and thievery and focus on resourcefulness, first impressions, and survival. Fred Marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time. Wish he had a website!"
387,Positive,LOVE THIS BOOK,I read this entire book from front to back in 1 day. IT WAS GREAT. Full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not
388,Positive,Awesome if not overplayed,"The first 5 songs are incredible, and the rest are OK. I live in France and Chumbawamba never got really big there so I haven't heard tubthumping a zillion times, which makes it still interesting to listen to."
389,Positive,A Great CD for all people,"I got this CD about a year and a half ago and I still listen to it. It is a very good CD with about 5 good dance tracks. Plus, the trumpet playing is great! I also liked on how smoothly the music and the vocals came together. This is truly a masterpiece"
390,Positive,"Beyond the mega-hit, preview of better things to come","Besides the much maligned mega-hit ""Tubthumping"" which I didn't like when it was first released but like now, this is a solid CD with great arrangements, lyrics, and performances. It's not perfect but how many CD's are perfect these days? I have recently discovered ""Ready Mades and Then Some"" - clearly a 5-star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song. Masterfully done. I won't write a song-by-song critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that. However, I do put forward a challenge to ""rtbarry"" in AZ to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a ""review"", if he is capable, to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this CD that rates it only one star? Or, does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were Kim Jong-il of North Korea? Otherwise, ""rtbarry"" don't waste our time with drivel."
391,Positive,It's Great!,This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them.
392,Negative,The One Star,"The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd."
393,Negative,I won't buy one again,"I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in ""best"" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!"
394,Negative,Non Computer Geek,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER, I have had a Hp 1100 and had moderate success with it, after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix, I just got this printer and it is even worse, it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box, the copy was consistantly misaligned. I am sending it back."
395,Negative,Curved Thomas the Train tracks,"Again, a good product, but over priced. I would try to find some gently used ones."
396,Negative,O-o-okay,"Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then, this whiny main character that, regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove Sabin is an honest, honorable man, she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way. Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn't deserve a man like Sabin. Lastly, to top it all off, after she's unloaded abuse after abuse on him, he simply tells her he's a good guy and she's like, oh, well, in that case I believe you and I love you. How utterly stupid! His actions obviously mean nothing, but she'll listen to what he says--wham--bam!Terrible, just terrible!"
397,Positive,Heads above the first book in the trilogy,"I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book."
398,Positive,Good book,"I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history."
399,Positive,Fantastic Sci Fi Classic,"The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite. The story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections, which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat. Can't recommend this series highly enough for any SciFi fan."
400,Positive,Phenomenal,"I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth's future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change."
401,Negative,"Good politics, but no science","The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction."
402,Positive,Asimow is one of the best writers of all times,"Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books."
403,Positive,Classic,"Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!"
404,Negative,Don't Bother,"Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However, you should stop there. Foundation is bad. This book is totally predictable. Read DUNE if you want something intelligent and entertaining. Read FOUNDATION if you want something that you probably won't even finish."
405,Negative,tough going,"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"
406,Negative,Dissatified,"I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story."
407,Negative,"Goes ""Haywire"" Regularly","Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I'm off to buy an Epson!"
408,Positive,"Old fashioned, sweet story.","Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it just the same. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it."
409,Negative,Stay Away,This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
410,Negative,worst.........movie............ever,"Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!"
411,Negative,Blu-Ray Review,"What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2."
412,Negative,LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!,There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
413,Negative,What did I watch?,So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
414,Positive,Great Writing,"I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?"
415,Positive,If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....,"Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (""Welcome to Mongolia!"" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book."
416,Negative,Banal and Boring,"No, I'm not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say ""nearly,"" because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I'm not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable..."
417,Positive,GREAT ITEM,I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it
418,Positive,Amazing Score.,"Wow, words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece. First I will start with the movie, brilliant! That is all there is to be said about the film. Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!"
419,Negative,Do not buy this camera,"Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it."
420,Positive,Brio Medium straight track,BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.
421,Negative,It's too simple even for a KISS book,"I know the whole point of ""dummie"" and ""KISS"" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste."
422,Positive,Quality from Tripp Lite as always,"I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables, due to their quality, and not being so proud of their name they triple the price."
423,Negative,awful,Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I've tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can't find packaging.
424,Positive,Good grill for the money.,"I've been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I've used it to grill steaks, duck breasts, veggies, and chicken. Takes longer than a gas grill, but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen."
425,Negative,Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me,"Couldn't agree more w/ Prendergast's review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called ""classic"" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book, but came on Amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version. Weird. Typos, poor punctuation, etc. ruined it for me."
426,Positive,entertaining action movie SPOILERS,the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
427,Positive,one more positive note,"Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well."
428,Negative,Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound,"Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they'll get a clue."
429,Positive,This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's,"This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as ""The Road Warrior."" And ""The Road Warrior"" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.""Mad Max"" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the ""action hero"" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre."
430,Positive,Great DVD packed with a ton of features!,"I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'"
431,Negative,AWFUL,"This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!"
432,Positive,"Oh, my God! It's Stereolab!!!","Ever since I got this album since last summer, I kept on thinking what this album will sound like. I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles' eerie song ""Revolution 9"" from the ""White Album."" I could've just imagined while listening to ""Baby Lulu"" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I've ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)"
433,Positive,Perfect Family Fun!!!,"This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!"
434,Positive,Great kids movie,The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.
435,Positive,Funny,"This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!"
436,Positive,Excellent Album,I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.
437,Positive,Well Played Kid's Music,"Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it's own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won't drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own."
438,Negative,Highway Robbery,"It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!"
439,Positive,well....,"i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are, at first glance, totally wrong for each other! i mean, a centuries old vampire, and a vampire slayer? it was ironic! i also liked that even though Quin was a cold fish on the outside, inside he was just as lonely as Rashel, even if he rarely admitted it. i loved the book and couldn't put it down! if u haven't read it yet, do so!"
440,Negative,Where are the woodwinds?,The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.
441,Positive,Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times,"This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual ""guide."" The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it's pretty easy to determine where each piece connects. We are happy customers!"
442,Positive,These Shoes are made for walking.,"In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, ""Merrills are a hug for the feet."" Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them."
443,Positive,Persuasive book with an unusual approach,"The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it."
444,Positive,Another Sensual Gem from this Composer,"This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended."
445,Positive,Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64,Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
446,Positive,You'll enjoy this CD,"I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don't mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It's light and it's fun. It's is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you'll get a big kick out of this disc."
447,Positive,Madonna is a great singer,"Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of ""Lament"" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song ""Beuonos Aires"" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less."
448,Positive,EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!,All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.
449,Negative,Disappointed in product quality and support,"After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also."
450,Positive,A text book worth keeping for reference,"This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up, with tabbed pages. I am sure I will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses."
451,Negative,"A small leak, right out of the box","I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this."
452,Negative,Did not last long,"We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it's inflated height. There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress, not compact but less risky than an airbed."
453,Positive,It's a great value!,"I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate, held it's firmness, was VERY easy to take down and easily stored. Now when my granddaughters come to visit, they have their own bed and great pajama parties."
454,Positive,Great bed for guests,"I highly recommend this item, and it's a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it's like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store."
455,Positive,comfortable sleep,"I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling, the height, all exceptional!I would reccomend this bed to anyone."
456,Negative,Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump,This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
457,Positive,Great Bed for Guests,Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!
458,Positive,Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump,"Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product."
459,Negative,Do Not Buy,"Inflates like a charm, then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours, I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have (queen) has worked for > 7 years."
460,Negative,It would be great if it stayed inflated!,"I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress."
461,Negative,Valve broke after a couple of uses,"My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can't inflate the mattress. Very poor quality."
462,Positive,Ecelente producto,"Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo."
463,Negative,WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN,"THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM."
464,Negative,Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop,"We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now."
465,Positive,Comfortable,"I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all, NO LEAKING!!!"
466,Negative,Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised,"I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope."
467,Positive,Works well,The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
468,Positive,Great for the summer,"My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again."
469,Positive,Quick and Easy,"This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump."
470,Positive,Love it,"We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town, they took my oldest sons room. We needed something for him to sleep on but didn't have much room. This twin airbed by Intex is great! I love the fact that the pump is built in. It doesn't get in the way like I thought it might. My son says it's very comfortable. It's easy to inflate and deflate."
471,Positive,Great Find at a Great Price,I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.
472,Positive,"Its better then a ""normal"" bed","I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud."
473,Negative,Electric pump failed,Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
474,Positive,Excellent product for the price,"Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy."
475,Positive,great mattress,I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
476,Negative,Would not recommend,"I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's."
477,Negative,Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!,"I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night."
478,Positive,The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!,I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone's place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself
479,Positive,Fantastic,"Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick, quiet and easy. Deflation works the same. Slight loss of air by early morning. Fits back into tote nicely, take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric, fold in thirds length wise, then role from bottom toward pump/pillow end. Easy to tote and store."
480,Positive,Better than the Queen size bed,"I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!"
481,Positive,Step's Best Work So Far!,"I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD ""Standing Room Only."" ""I'm So Glad"" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a ""must buy"" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year."
482,Positive,200 bucks?,"I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways, The case doesn't get the best air so I'd recommend getting more fans.If you have problems with the front USB hubs (pc freezes when you plug something in them), unplug the very BOTTOM black wire.[r|r][w|w][g|g][b|b][b|[]"
483,Positive,DVD review,Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
484,Negative,Not worth the money,Not what I thought I was getting. I don't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.
485,Positive,good,"It was good, is not like out of this world and really amazing, but it works soooooo good! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it, it turns off automatically, that sucks!"
486,Negative,Too Expensive,"I used it once and have not touched it since, the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft, Waste of MONEY"
487,Negative,No way!,This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
488,Negative,Not worth the money,"What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money."
489,Positive,GREAT prodct,"For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I've never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It's a little large, and kinda hard but that's okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price."
490,Negative,Awful,"This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product."
491,Negative,Too big!,"While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product."
492,Negative,Awful!,"I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the ""bunny ears"" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product."
493,Negative,HATE IT!,I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
494,Positive,Fantastic (and FAST!),"This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum ""my first vibrator"" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more ""lifted"" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!"
495,Positive,"After 6 years, this album is still awesome.","This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You'll definitely get your money's worth from this album. And even though it's over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time."
496,Negative,I'm glad I didn't pay for it.,"I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up."
497,Positive,Great book!,This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.
498,Positive,Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good,"This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her ""dialouges"" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like ""Evergreen"" (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), ""The Music of the Night"" , & ""Somewhere"" (not favorable with Il Divo)"
499,Negative,Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!,"Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter..."
500,Negative,misleading photo,"There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the ""too good to be true"" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier."
501,Negative,Waste of money,"If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!"
502,Negative,What a waste!,After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
503,Negative,Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!,"Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 ""generations"" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS."
504,Negative,Confused,"I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first."
505,Positive,Great deliver of all products,Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.
506,Positive,"Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story","Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them."
507,Negative,Oh Romeo,Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
508,Positive,A good introduction to the tragedies.,"Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose."
509,Negative,RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!,"We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!"
510,Negative,Good book -- but not this edition,"This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version."
511,Negative,How do films like this get made?,"If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!"
512,Negative,What the Heck ???,"The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer's uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don't get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!"
513,Negative,"Cute, But a Little Cheap...","This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better."
514,Negative,Disappointed,"I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!"
515,Negative,"no color, no buy","I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I'd end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!"
516,Positive,Not classic Yello - but very very good!,"Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!"
517,Negative,Disappointed!,"Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? ""Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!""I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!"
518,Negative,A double edged sword,"This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson ""in his own words"" but were nothing more than fabrication."
519,Negative,MANSON HATES EMMONS.,"Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,""Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook.""The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual."
520,Negative,"Lies, Lies, Lies","For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it."
521,Negative,REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said ""man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system"" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
522,Positive,I couldn't put it down,"Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable."
523,Negative,sadly predictable,"If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied."
524,Negative,Struggled Through!,"I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!"
525,Negative,Klaatu Hopeless,"I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However ""Hope"" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
526,Positive,A Must read,This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.
527,Positive,A unique take on a classic theme,"I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating."
528,Positive,One Brave Act changes a civilization,"this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing ""object"" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read"
529,Positive,GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price,"Love the book, love dealing with Amazon.com I've been dealing with Amazon for years now, and have never had a problem with them. THANKS ONCE AGAIN AMAZON."
530,Positive,Great space heater!,"It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it."
531,Positive,Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.,"After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of ""Portrait of a Marriage"" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call ""The Three V's."" The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge."
532,Negative,Buyer Beware!!,If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
533,Negative,This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale,"Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration."
534,Negative,Worst scanner I've owned.,"I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The ""auto"" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do."
535,Positive,a childhood favorite,"In ""The Greengage Summer"" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended."
536,Positive,"Forget Belkin, look no further than the GUF320","This thing was easy to intall. I have a Dual 1.25 G4 Mac. No driver installations under Panther 10.3.3. If you're pre 10.2.X on a Mac you'll have to visit Iogear's website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn't have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market."
537,Positive,Great Book,"For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book"
538,Positive,Most Interesting Ending,"This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the ""natural disaster"" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too"
539,Positive,Afghan lovers unite,"This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts, I had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos. I recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy."
540,Negative,complete nuisance,"I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box."
541,Negative,bad company,"The scanner looks nice but very deceiving, I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets, now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit. (Bad company)"
542,Negative,does not work,You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?
543,Negative,Decent player... while it lasts,After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
544,Negative,Poor substitute for an iPod,"Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap."
545,Negative,Yet another broken headphone jack.,"After roughly a year of fairly reliable use, I've also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack. Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (""limited"" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider ""fixing"", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I'm outright angry that I'm not alone."
546,Positive,Discontinued 70PD05500032?,"Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as ""Discontinued"". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion."
547,Positive,Top Notch Christmas Jazz,"I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD's. How did I miss this one for so long? It's a winner from begining to end. The Trio really delivers some tasty versions of your favorite Christmas standards. Each nugget features a unique take on the song without straying too far from the original sound. Very upbeat and lively thtoughout. Not your standard, elevator jazz."
548,Negative,review,"The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy, hard to follow."
549,Negative,Wow,"I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD."
550,Positive,"Basketball, not at its best","Ok, as yall might know me, im Gamer8. To the game. This game is sorta like the first NBA Street game for the PS2. It has some flaws, such as lighting. Also, at points of the game, you might say, is this game worth $50.00? Well, its worth about $30.00. 1.- Its not a good game for portability. 2.- Lighting is bad at times 3.-Can be hard for beginners. So I suggest that you must know what the first few NBA Street games are about before buying thsi title. PS:Its a fun game after a while"
551,Negative,never again,"I bought this heater and it didn't even work on arrival. The pilot light came on, but nothing else. What a waste of time and money."
552,Negative,Reaching for the Light,I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!
553,Negative,Hardly worth reading,"This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read."
554,Positive,Statin levels,"Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins, (Icluding monacolins KA form).The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label. They want everyone reliant on large pharma. This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption."
555,Negative,DECEPCIONADO,"Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería ""el libro"" para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil, lo primero que leí fue lo referente a estoa paises. QUE DECEPCIÓN!La idea del libro es excelente y seguramente la autora tuvo que viajar, leer y estudiar mucho, pero pienso que debió haber pedido ayuda a que revisaran sus capítulos personas conocedoras de cada país o región.Tiene muchos errores históricos, geográficos, culinarios y de ortografía del idioma original. Estoy preparando una lista de ellos que posteriormente enviaré.La felicito por su dedicación, perodes graciadamente el resultado no es del todo bueno.Hans Rio de Janeiro/Brasil"
556,Negative,"Excellent show, poor sound","Unfortunatelly the DVD is dissapointing for Tina's fans. The show is fantastic, but both Dolby Digital and DTS version of this DVD have one of the worst sounds I ever heard. My subwoofer didn't move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames. More, the soundtrack was re-edited with sound taken from other concerts (that's incredible - at one moment I swear that I heard the word Munchen despite the fact that the concert is in Amsterdam). And, oh yes, the DVD is overpriced. Forget ""Amsterdam"" and don't miss ""One Last Time in Concert"" as it has verry good sound quality and image. Not speaking abut the phantastic show..."
557,Positive,Northwinds - 'Great God Pan' (Black Widow),"Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work,but I'll try.A French progressive outfit that blends old school Sabbath with celtic music.Would that formula even fly?It does here.Notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on 'Great...'.A total of six cuts,with each one averaging eight minutes.Tunes I couldn't get enough of were the title track,""Great God Pan"",their Sabbath cover of ""A National Acrobat""(talk about covering an obscurity-great work!!)and the epic ""The Forest Of Koncerei"".A real keeper."
558,Negative,It does not use your classification for the musics.,"I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device."
559,Negative,Returned the View twice in one week,"I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems."
560,Negative,Worst mp3 player on the market.,"I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product. This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life. I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please, please do not waste your money & time on this product. I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it."
561,Positive,Nice Device,"This is a nice MP3. I got it on Black Friday on Amazon for only $99.99 , yes Sansa View 8 GB MP3 280. While everyone else was looking at the lighting rounds on Black Friday they didn't see the tiny small icons around the today's deal page. If you use a computer you should be able to tranfer sound & images files without using a program. It's basic computer 101. I use Sony's SonicStage myself. Records at 192 for crisp sound."
562,Positive,This player is very very good,"Wow, this has been one of the best products I bought, with great sound, great quality pictures in the video, easy to load files into memory, compatible with WMP, it also brings a player-Sync in the installation cd . I like, I take all Pareto, I plug in the car, sounds very hard, is extremely friendly to navigate between playlists. Presntacion has several languages''. The Spanish translation used is very good and relevant, unlike others who say one thing and mean another. I recommend"
563,Negative,Don't buy without a good return policy.,This player freezes constantly. It's possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don't buy without a good return policy.
564,Negative,Don't buy this piece of crap,"I bought this piece of crap and found out it's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So, I have basically a $200 radio. Worthless. DO NOT BUY!!!"
565,Negative,Nothing is from scratch?,"Why on Earth would ""nothing is made from scratch"" be a selling point for a cookbook? How horrid!For good, simple cooking, look into Mark Bittman's cookbooks."
566,Positive,Really funny and exciting,"I'd say this book is extremely informative for the responsible, occasional sit at home drug user. I read it and learned a few things about the law I didn't know about. Definately a must read for anyone who uses any drugs whether it be a little or a lot. If you're a dealer it gives you an outlook of legal information, but one of the author's commandments in the book is ""Thou shall not sell"" which every dealer already knows. The only rule for dealers is DON'T GET CAUGHT."
567,Positive,Good book,Good story and interesting characters..A lot of history in this story that I found to be interesting..the life of Indians has always fascinated me.
568,Positive,Great History,"I am a big fan of Ms. Blake's but this was not one of her better books. It dragged a lot at times but the history involved in the story more than made up for it. If you're a fan of people and their cultures, you might want to give this book a try."
569,Positive,Handy card holders,"I play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards, which, since I have small hands and am also a klutz, I drop a lot and mix up. The card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone. They are also slightly curved to prevent other players from ""accidentally"" seeing your cards. A very good deal for klutzes everywhere."
570,Negative,It does the job,"If you can't hold the cards, this will work but I believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box. The idea is to make it easier for the individual. It can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose. A block of wood will do better. The card holder shouldn't be a game within a game."
571,Positive,Buy this now!,"Very attractive, solid and sturdy, materials are very well organized. Not the cheapest, but well worth it -- especially at the discount Amazon provides... And then there's the content -- top notch stuff, perfect."
572,Positive,Forward the Mage an Alternate Style,"Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire, Swift and Sterne. This book set in ""Joe's World"" is the second book in this series. Although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading. Once read I was hooked into asking ""where is the rest of this story"", this is quite normal for this style of writing and I await eagerly the next volume."
573,Positive,Fantasy writing at its best,"Eric Flint and Richard Roach's Forward The Mage is fantasy writing at its best: an artist-swordsman faces an evil sorcerer, arrest, and politics when his artistic ambitions are rerouted in a struggle for survival. Both feature fast-paced action and complex, believable settings."
574,Negative,A device grows old,"Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap, but this book focuses on Gwendolyn, Benvenutti & the Sorcerer. Story of events in these characters' lives before, during, and after, Phil Strangler. Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time, and not as funny. If you loved Philosophical Strangler, you'll probably love this one, but if you were growing weary by the end of the Strangler, you should probably pass this one up."
575,Positive,Cool Documentary,"I was extremely excited to pop this DVD into my computer and watch it. But please be aware this is more like a documentary. And please don't let me deter you from buying this DVD.A lot of interviews about the the World Championship mixed with some GREAT interludes of the interviewee riding. Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states, this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through, not about their riding skill and extreme stunts. I expected non-stop action, but this is still a great DVD to add to my collection. I've watched it a few times just to watch them ride their riding chapters.A must buy for anyone serious about competitive DH racing. Shred it up all!"
576,Negative,Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships,"This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a ""Nimitz""-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a ""great"" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book."
577,Negative,Jabra Eargels,The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.
578,Negative,Jabra Ear Gels,"These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!"
579,Negative,What a waste,"Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something, but good luck with that. In-ear earbuds work so much better than these."
580,Positive,"Fast delivery, great product","Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw."
581,Negative,JABRA EAR GELS,Save youself some money. The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste. They actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from Jawbone.I was even more disappointed that I paid $4.63 shipping on a worthless $9.99 product. It's not even worth returning. Lesson learned. Hopefully you will also.
582,Positive,jabra eargels,These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
583,Negative,Don't waste your money,"They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them."
584,Negative,Not well suited for the Jawbone II,"When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all."
585,Negative,pain in the ear,"They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically, a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped."
586,Positive,JEG,The product arrived as expected. The ear gels fit the JawBone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.
587,Negative,scottiesgems,I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
588,Negative,Don't waste your money,"After ordering these eargels, I spent an enormous amount of time trying to make them fit. It was useless. Unless you have elephant ears, or you wish to grease them and use a hammer to insert them, they won't work."
589,Negative,This movie is not all that,"originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star, but because of one of the last scenes where ugly t(telemachus) threw two spears at once, i give it two stars. Everything was horrible to my opinion. The accents kept changing everything. If you read the book before you watched the movie, you would thinkt hat this was all a joke. So if anything just read the book by itself. So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T"
590,Negative,Hmmmmmmm,"I've seen better movies on The All News Channel. Odysseus was played very well, but his part was boring. As well as the rest of the movie. Scylla looks like 1930's cartoons.I drew better stuff in 1st grade.Every single scene looks so fake it isn't even funny. I can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm. I would not recommend this to anyone young or old. This movie isn't worth a penny in my book!"
591,Negative,"Crap, all crap","...you would have noticed how horrible the allusions are in this crap-that-calls-itself-a-movie. The characters were simply annoying; Telemakhos, the whiny school boy that cries whenever he doesn't get his way, creepy Athena, who's eyes are SUPPOSED to be gray, Penelope, who obviously has a more pleasureful time on the water on the beach than with her husband, and of course Odysseus, who would make me weep if he was my captain. The sets looked as if elementary school kids put them together, Scylla was a sock-puppet, and the shades were just sad. I have never in my life seen such crap and I hope you won't fall for these other 4-star reviews that make me want to PUKE!"
592,Positive,The Odyssey with Armand Asanti,I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.
593,Negative,"Great movie, but what's with the price?","I have seen this movie before, and was looking to buy it to show in my classroom, but...why the heck is it $99? It's good, but not THAT good!"
594,Negative,Very BORING,"This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see."
595,Positive,"Birds, Beasts and Relatives","As always, Gerard Durrell's works make me want to hop on a flight to Greece right now. His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again. Slow paced and funny, this enjoyable book put Corfu at the top of my list of places to go."
596,Negative,I Don't Think So!,"Quite often, bringing a classic story like ""Moby Dick"" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did."
597,Negative,The white whale isn't,The annimation for the white whale was lousy. The original with G. Peck is a classic & you can't do a remake to match it. The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk.
598,Negative,Did not fit in ear,"I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear, in fact, after trying for a couple of weeks, I could not tell which one was the R and which was the L as they both fit so poorly. The spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing.I threw these out and purchased the Umbo earbud. Much, much better fit there."
599,Positive,Great Series opener,"I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all."
600,Positive,The Face of a Stranger,"Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory. This is a wonderful series and I would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book, ""The Face of a Stranger"" which is the first in the series, for a more complete appreciation of each following book."
601,Negative,Waste of time and money,"I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder. I have sprayed all furniture, bedding, hard to reach spaces,etc. And a month later I still have fleas. It is a major waste of time and money."
602,Negative,This is not a normal Mercedes Lackey book.,"When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows, without true substance (or reasons) to their actions. I couldn't find reasons to cheer for anyone. One problem is there were too many people to follow easily. Since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world."
603,Negative,I hope Frances Mayes Got A Lot of Money for the Rights...,"I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can't understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms, foolishly thinking that the movie would get better, and after that I was done. Another good thing about DVDs is that you don't have to be kind and rewind. It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR. This movie is right up there with Ishtar! Except worse!"
604,Negative,very much disappointed,"It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View."
605,Positive,A very sexy and entertaining film! 5 stars!,"A very sexy and entertaining film. Sure, this film is heartwarming and inspiring. It is also funny and pleasant. BUT it is also sexy, very sexy infact! And it is very enjoyable and entertaining. 5 stars!"
606,Negative,Terrible movie,"I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
607,Negative,Last time I let the Blockbuster guy recommend a movie....,"What a waste of two hours! As a romantic comedy, it falls short on both romance and comdey. As a movie trying to give over a lesson, it is trite, overdone, and poorly performed. The writing is unimpressive, the story is dull and far fetched, and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot. What was the point? They seemed to have forgotten to find one."
608,Negative,under the Tuscany Sun,"Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new, just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie."
609,Positive,Wonderfully Inspiring Movie!,"In this movie, as with life(usually),our ""plans"" from our ""beginnings"", don't work out like we think they will.[If yours have and you are one of the those living your dreams, twenty, fifty, etc. years later, I'm sure you are counting your blessings! ;)]Frances' ""new"" story begins when she acts on instinct instead of ""planning"" and thus life begins, rather unexpectedly to Frances, to have its own ""design"" for her life. She has her hopes and dreams for what her life will become. Little does she know she will get exactly what she asks for. However, as in true life, it may not be in the way you expect it.A truly, inspirational movie for anyone struggling through some tough times in your life. I can't tell you how many times I've seen it, but I probably couldn't use my fingers to count, even if I counted each of them twice!Also, must mention Diane Lane, Sandra Oh, you guys are the best!"
610,Negative,Diane Lane is great but skip this movie,Diane Lane is the only redeemable part to this lame effort.The film takes tremendous liberties with the plot from the book. Way way too much PC madness.A waste of time and money.
611,Positive,Canon NB-5L good for the XS200IS,"I think it's always best to get the actual canon battery rather than a ""replacement substitute"". The battery life so far is pretty good- at least 8 hours."
612,Negative,Here's what really happened...,"The John Houseman character from the excellent James Caan original version, jumped into a time machine with the intent of destroying the social commentary critical to multinational monopolies from the first film and spreading cultural plastics so prevalent in his future history. The result is dumbed down junk where you must give up the idea of wondering how movie executive's decisions are made. I think he did a good job."
613,Negative,"A failure of ""Battlefield Earth"" proportions!","I should say, ""worse than Battlefield Earth proportions!"" This whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go, ""why?"" Everything about this convoluted, sarcastic, beefed up, badly edited tripe is confusing to watch, poorly executed and loses you 10 minutes into the film. You are introduced to boring characters, cliched camera angles and material we all know John Mcteirnan is far more capable of. I was thankful I got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks! If you really want to see the real ""Rollerball"" rent (don't buy) the original. The original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loud-James Caan! He's a legend man!! I don't know what kind of future Chris Klein has in movies but as far as action movies go, let's just put it this way, we already have Keanu Reeves and quite bluntly, he's a much better actor. Steer clear and save your money!"
614,Negative,TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!,"This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star."
615,Negative,Horrible.,I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn't.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.
616,Negative,ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.,"I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can't get any worse and then it did. <repeat> And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would."
617,Negative,"Junk, need I say more JUNK","This movie should have never been made, there is basically no story present and is just a bunch of people going around on rollerblades bashing each other's brains in. I was really looking foreword to this flick, it's previews were misleading, it looked as though it was brilliant and exciting. Guess what, it's really really really NOT!Trust me don't waste your time unless the only thing better you have to do is give the cat a bath, even then I really don't believe you should waste your time!"
618,Positive,I Hope I'm Not Allergic To It!,"I ordered this, based on the reviews. I ordered on 11/16, and received it on 11/21 (I needed it by 11/29). I love the musky smell. I only tested 1 drop on my wrist. I have to say that after a couple of hours, the smell turned into a strong sex smell... not bad, but definitely sex. I'm going to test it out at work next week, but the real test is on 11/30. I'll report my findings then.12/6/12: It works! This is definitely going to be my ""go-to"" scent. It drove my man crazy! I love it. I will purchase again."
619,Positive,concisely written,This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests. We are never going to be fluent in Russian but this little handbook makes communication possible. Thank you .
620,Negative,What the????,"It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!"
621,Negative,When Good Products Go Bad,"I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that, not the manufacturers). After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives. I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line (533/633) to buy a better one. Don't know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product."
622,Negative,Very disappointed,"Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again."
623,Positive,Very large,"These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However, for the price, I still think they are a great bargain. They are very heavy duty and will probably last many years. They are also very warm. Almost too warm here in southen California. Those people in cold climates would LOVE them! Anyhow, I would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit. But I just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine."
624,Negative,dont get it,Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man. U should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul PET.
625,Negative,Not a good toy,This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
626,Positive,JBL MRX512M,"JBL has several price points for it's professional sound reinforcement products. JRX is the least expensive and MRX is the second least expensive. The MRX series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price. These are normally $700.00 each. Amazon offered a new ""opened"" package which I was able to purchase for much less. These are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle. Power handling is between 400 and 1600 watts depending on the program. Nominal wattage is 800 watts into 8 ohms. Excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues. Speakon in and out connectors only. Non protruding handle. Great product."
627,Negative,Good for downhill only,"I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled, this only good for down hill. While it is well built, you can't propel this trike as advertized. Save your money, don't buy this!"
628,Positive,Pratchetts Best!!!!,"Since I am a literature student I am a reads-everything-I-can-get person. Having once recognized Pratchetts works, I left all my classic German literature aside and started reading and reading and reading... . But this book, ""Small Gods"", has beaten everything I've read before (even my all-time favorite ""Faust"" - you know: the Goethe one). It is witty, intelligent and above all deaply questioning. I remained nodding all the time:""Yes, that's what I always believed religion is about."""
629,Positive,Pratchett Review Haiku,I've been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here's an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky. Brutha must showthe heretics Truth.
630,Negative,Why do people like this garbage?,"Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand."
631,Negative,Boring plot.,"I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic."
632,Negative,cross contamination,"The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great ""silent damage"" to one's intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet."
633,Positive,Just Accepting Gluten Free Life,"I have read the other reviews of this book, and while I appreciate everyone's opinions I must say that this book helped me immensely! I am new to the gluten free life. I have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues. I had NO prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears. I haven't read Against the Grain, so I cannot compare the two. Jax made me laugh often, even through my tears. I recommend it for those just starting out."
634,Negative,Terrible!,"My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck's book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck's book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease."
635,Negative,get the facts,"Most of the people who gave shining, sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel. It is not boring. Jax is a talented writer, I'll give her that. But when I read on page 394 that the perscription drugs I was on and had been on for 5 years (both Pfizer drugs) were not GF I was seriously troubled.Many follow-ups with both Pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book is.I went off my meds immediately thinking I was injesting gluten. I suffered the undue consequences of going off ""cold turkey"" when I needed to taper off. In actuality those meds ARE GF, and always were!!!If you want the facts (as boring as they are) -- dont rely on this book. If you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read, but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt, as they say.Jax was indeed very lax when writing this book."
636,Positive,Thank God for Jax Peters Lowell ! !,"What a wonderful, easy book to read. And so helpful. So many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read. Not the Gluten-Free Bible. It is clear, easy-to-understand and very engaging. I really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten-free to everyday life. It is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very, very informative at the same time. I have never written a book review before, but I am so impressed with The Gluten-Free Bible that I want to share these thoughts with everyone and I intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful, witty writer. Enjoy! To your health!"
637,Negative,Not useful and a waste of money,The software does not cocur to the current USMLE pattern.It is a waste of money. The questions present on the trial CD are misleading....they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!
638,Negative,Devoid of depth or even much substance,"The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight."
639,Negative,Try something else.,"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters."
640,Positive,Mr. Dickens slams industrial horror scenes.,"Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown. He writes with a sharp knife about poverty, hunger, cruel management and lack of compassion. Humor here is on the grim side."
641,Negative,Less than one star.,"Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!! Unbelievable! 2. the heroine was way too dependent upon daddy; did she not have any type of backbone? 3. The biggest, Ben knew the truth and yet he had to create all this angst on both their parts!!! YUCK!!"
642,Negative,Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game,"I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other."
643,Positive,Rivetting Sci-Fi in Paradise,"A regular nail biter: strong plotlines, excellent cast give relaible performances, killer locations. Sci-fi what-if horror flick with a twist. Who knew Tim Hutton was a sci-fi fan? Nice uncomplicated performance.,"
644,Positive,A Must Have,"For those familiar with the Burzum name, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is largely and widely accepted as his crowning achievement. Utilizing a stunning mixture of layered guitar melodies, gloomy synths, and thunderous percussion, Varg works his way through three hypnotic metal songs before the ambitious ambient outro - Tomhet. Rather than sit here and rattle on about the magic contained within this record, I would rather just claim that it is a must have for any black metal fan, and ranks among the highest calibur or metal releases period."
645,Positive,Super Reader,"An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos, a la John Myers Myers' Silverlock.Dracula has found another way to be in charge in England, by marrying in to the royal family. To prevent problems, he has had the Great Detective thrown in a prison camp.So when a serial killed called Silver Knife is killing vampire whores, it falls to the Diogenes Club to investigate. Vampires heal normal wounds, but not silver. The investigation uncovers a lot more than just a chain of killings."
646,Negative,Politics?,"A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read."
647,Positive,A Must for Handgunners - Old and New,"This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive. But it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts. See alsoThe Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About Guns, Crime, and the Second Amendment."
648,Negative,Lousy Camera,"This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally ""twisted"".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one."
649,Negative,Piece of junk,Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
650,Positive,Video too!,I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .
651,Positive,Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!,"This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the ""best"" of Motown, in which the Holland/Dozier/Holland tagline under the title of the record meant high quality R&B;, and almost always resulted in a mega-hit. The collection begins with the very earliest hit -- Eddie Holland singing ""Jamie"", and proceeds through most of the major early hits of The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Mary Wells, The Marvalettes, The 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, and more.This CD replaces my old collection of 45 RPM recordings, and has allowed me to enjoy the Motown Sound without haaving a huge number of CD's to collect. The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: ""My World is Empty Without You"" and ""Forever Came Today"". In all, the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories: The soundtrack to my teenage years; Rock On!!"
652,Positive,Great true crime read,"I really have to give this author credit, as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin's killers, and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother. The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read."
653,Negative,static central,"Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices, speakers and headphones, and all have the same result, static. Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $3 shipped to begin with."
654,Negative,I expected something better,"EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that's what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I've long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn't get what they expected based on the product description, I think it's safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I'd buy from another shipper."
655,Negative,Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail,"Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first ""click"" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones."
656,Negative,Freud is crazy!,"I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so."
657,Positive,"If life is a dream, then don't wake me up","This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work."
658,Positive,It arriived,Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d
659,Positive,Barely Unbeatable Theory,"Freud's ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory."
660,Positive,When did Grandpa die and what do we tell the kids?,"Grandma and a brother? That's just weird. I'm a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I, I!, bought my Granddaughter the dollhouse and the full set of house furniture. What the, no, wtf were they thinking? Simpletons rule the fricking world. Grandma? Grandpa. Brother? Sister. Idiots.That said my Granddaughter loves this entire set. Full on wonderful for her, and yes if they came out with Grandpa with a sister I would buy both sets, throw the older brother away and give her the rest so maybe their not idiots, just soulless vampires."
661,Negative,Amazon.com sent wrong size,Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
662,Positive,One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.,"This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here. What is here is his last composition, the “Hesperus-Bahnen Waltz”, published as Op 279, after the forty-three year old composer’s death."
663,Positive,"Janet, is the Best female singer!","I watched The Velvet rope tour on HBO and it was the bomb, it was the greatest tour that I have ever seen, everything was choreographed pefectly, the music was slammin and Janet really communicated with her fans. When she sang ""I get Lonely"", ""Nasty"" and ""You"", it sent me Crazy. I love you Janet!"
664,Positive,Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!,"If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a ""must have"" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!"
665,Positive,Captivating,"Very simply, I was unable to put this book down. Not unlike some of the other reviewers I too was on my way to Boston on business whilst reading this ""glued to my seat"" book. For the first time, I can say that I was pleased for all the flight delays as I managed to finish reading this book on route. I am an avid reader and can say without reservation that Rapid Descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors, such as Crichton, Grisham, Cook etc to name a few of my favorites. Well Done Dr. Jack when's the next one....."
666,Positive,Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.,"Yes, by reading every review we all know by now that Sheri is a wee bit annoying, and her ""participants"" are an interesting sort of people, AND YES it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it. BUT everything in this DVD is so valuable! I learned everything I needed to know through this DVD without taking more time off work to go to classes. And since it was always available to me by the touch of a button I was able to review the important things while I was acually in labor. I had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be 5 mins apart before we went to the hospital, so I popped in the DVD, and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance, he was taking notes! This was my first child and thanks to Sheri my labor was only 12 hour and I only pushed for 20 mins, 3 good ones and he was out! I think doing what Sheri says and waiting till your dialated 5 cm before you get an epideral was really key."
667,Positive,Great Information,My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We've been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.
668,Positive,Good Overview and Very Informative,"I really enjoyed this DVD, it provided good content at a nice pace. I highly recommend this DVD."
669,Positive,Superb!,"When I was 5 months pregnant, I'm desperate to take Child Birth Class in order to help me have Normal Delivery. I searched over the net the best detailed class. Voila! I came accross this product on one of my searches. I never had second thoughts of ordering this product. I regularly viewed and applied all the techniques taught on DVD. It really works! I had an easy labor plus I had Normal Delivery. Superb! I recommend this DVD for those who wanted a Modern and comprehensive Child Birth Class. - Margery Bermejo (Davao City, Philippines)"
670,Positive,Chilbirth Education Video,Great videos!!!! I'm a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch! They helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience. They also helped review and update me on current L and D practices. Thanks for a wonderful product!
671,Negative,TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH,"I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest."
672,Positive,GO FOR IT!,"This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman, why not?) The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it's growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it's like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn't be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!"
673,Positive,LOVED this video!,"After I bought this DVD, I watched it about 8 times on my own and with my husband before our son was born. We both laughed at Sheri's mannerisms but really loved all we learned from her. We both felt more prepared, even though we weren't able to attend birthing classes."
674,Positive,RECOMMEND!,"I was going for a med-free birth...not for any reason other than I wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and I and I figured I could do it as well. It's what our bodies are meant to do, right? Well, this DVD was great! It saved me from paying over $100 for a lamaze class and I felt the stuff she touched on for the lamaze section was perfect. I did not have a doula or a midwife...just my husband, an awesome nurse and this DVD. I enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch. It's a bit OUTDATED, and CHEESY, but overall very honest and good. Worked for me. If anything, its worht the few $$ for reference AFTER a birthing class. (I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, b/c they should really look into updating it soon)."
675,Negative,Couldn't finish watching,"Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes, but wanted a refresher before the big event. While the information is consistent with what we've learned from other professionals - the presenter is terribly annoying. Although we wanted the information, the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching. If you can deal with the presenter's sense of humor, you'll benefit from the information - good luck!"
676,Positive,very informative,"Laugh and Learn About Childbirthexcellent information, and humorous all at the same time !!!"
677,Positive,Poignant & Intelligent -- give this one a listen!,"Ron's playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no-holds-barred clairvoyance I came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me. I find him to be a certifiable, bonafide talent -- one of life's genuine little treasures secreted away in the mountains of Montana. In a way I am [selfishly] sorry to hear his album is realizing such widespread success -- I was kind of hoping to keep him all to myself."
678,Positive,"Exquisitely fresh, jazzy & melodius, crisp & classy!","Mysterious jazz that rolls into the imaginary worlds of a Native American dance, a smokey Nashville nightclub, a cruise with the whales...hints of Paul Consort with a crisp and haunting classical foundation, a journey through the 20th Century...and back again into the lonely Montana night where Ron strolls with star gazing abandon."
679,Negative,At least it's free,"I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though..."
680,Positive,Yardbirds,"Very informative and fun to listen to for someone of my generation. I had heard bits and pieces of the Yardbirds story, but never the complete picture."
681,Positive,One of my favorites...,"...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in ""Revenge"". So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, ""got-nothing-else-to-do"" movies.It's definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right. Give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
682,Positive,"Nice French farce, similar to 'un elephant'","Showed this film to my French class, and it was a hit. The same actors as in Jean de Florette, but about 20 years later. Thoroughly enjoyable."
683,Positive,Daniel Auteuil is fabulous,I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
684,Negative,This book is AWEFUL,"I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."
685,Positive,Captivating and Engrossing,"When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong, self-assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing. I have given this book to my sisters and to several friends. And whenever I get into a discussion about 'good books' this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa. He wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english. And this was the first book I thouht to send him. Well that and a dictionary.Thanks to Jean Auel for writing such a great novel."
686,Positive,Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!!,"I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence......."
687,Positive,one of the best series EVER!!!,"When my dad first gave me this book to read, it had the orignal cover, and was sort of deteriorating, and I had a feeling that I woudln't really like it. That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it's hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!"
688,Negative,Giants Mats,The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that's like having a pair of bootleg mats.
689,Positive,Exactly what I ordered,"Product arrived on time, in great condition. As usual, Amazon provided a vehicle to acquire a product that I wanted."
690,Positive,Touching,"Beautiful film, excellent acting. The story transports you to other worlds to experience the full gamut of emotions. These are real people with real issues, another example of life being stranger than fiction, as portrayed in a film. Hope there's a Part II. :)"
691,Positive,One of the best foreign language films,"For once, a film coming from a north european country that is neither unhealthy nor perverse.Suzanne Bier is a wonderful director as she proved in two of my favorite films ""Things we lost in the fire"" and ""Brothers""."
692,Positive,Wonderfully emotional.,Great story line. The pacing of the plot was well thought out (sometimes rather predictable) but the actors really brought a sense of honesty.
693,Negative,The remix is different,"I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster, so decided what the heck. I chose poorly - the remixes just don't sound right. For all I know, this 2006 version was the original intent, I hope not."
694,Negative,Why the remix?,"If a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like Pearl Jam did with their recent re-release of 10, not replace the original album mix like Mushroom is doing here. This new remix is not as good as the original versions of these songs. Wish they would remaster the original mix and issue it."
695,Negative,Art and Passion...but no Science,"A series of short vignettes about fencing, none detailed enough to impart and real knowledge. A definite lack of technical instruction on fencing. Not sure who this video would be useful for...certainly not a beginner trying to learn about the technical aspects of the sport."
696,Negative,No illustrations,"The Kindle version has no illustrations, and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses. The limericks appear without logical line shifts, and where the illustration is supposed to be, it just says [illustration] which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all.It's free, but it's hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it, at least for me."
697,Negative,No drawings!,"I love love loved Edward Lear but unfortunately this free copy doesn't have the marvelous drawings. It would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book, one that is illustrated."
698,Positive,what hard rock is all about,"Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis."
699,Positive,Thuvia maid of mars,"Typical ERB Mars series, which I find light reading. Not too much depth or thought provoking, but nice escape from everyday."
700,Negative,Old-School Bore Metal,"This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal. This is reminiscent of mediocre late 80's trash metal, with all songs sounding the same. Mid-paced tempos and simplistic solos abound, with moronic wayyyyy-out-of-date pretend-satanic lyrics and cartoony cover art. Just dumb, dumb, dumb. Want real thrash metal, aside from the Big Four? Try Coroner, Arch Enemy, Arsis, The Crown, the Haunted, Hypocrisy, and a ton of others that poop all over this album from miles above."
701,Negative,Only works with Microsoft e-mail clients,"If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you! Not only that, but the fact that CA Anti-virus will ONLY work with MS Outlook or Outlook Express is not revealed in any documentation. I found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my Opera mail folder and couldn't clean or quarantine it! The CA tech confirmed that the AV program only works with MS e-mail clients. To me this is false advertising!!!"
702,Positive,A new beginning...,"This was their first true recording project, although it was thier second full album. I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it's an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come. Purchas and enjoy!"
703,Negative,Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item,"Do not order this item and expect to get what you see. I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A). Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon's blessing. Buyer beware. This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon's partners, and Amazon will do nothing to help you."
704,Negative,It's an ad.,"This book is nothing more than a 160 page ad for Stauber's school/store in CakeEater, MN. There is no ""How To"" advise in this book."
705,Positive,A Jesse Stuart Harvest: My opinion of it,"A Jesse Stuart Harvest is a collection of stories by Jesse Stuart. All the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the Old West. This book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author, Jesse Stuart.I think this book is really good because it takes you on a trip through time and into a world of adventure. My favorite story was Snake Teeth because it has a lot of cliffhangers and adventure. I would recommend this book for 9 yrs.-adults because normally after 9 years of age you will understand the dialect in this book."
706,Negative,Flyboys,"Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film."
707,Positive,World War I aviation visited,"I have enjoyed watching ""Flyboys"" several times. The special effects are outstanding and very lifelike. One of the features that I really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end. I noticed that one of the people interviewed was from Colorado and as a result I went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the movie.I find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it."
708,Positive,fly boys,"i haven't watched this movie. it was purchased for a christmas present. i heard about this movie on american family radio and they gave it wonderfuly reviews. my brother is ex-military and loves these types of movie. since afr gave them a wonderful review, i thought this would be something that he would enjoy."
709,Negative,Sappy and Stupid,"This is a very bad movie. Bad music, bad acting, bad special effects. A slow and predictable plot line. Glad we borrowed it and didn't buy this one!"
710,Positive,This CD Rulez,"I think that this is one of the best CD's ever. I really like the song ""Gravity"" and ""Next Time"". Those are the best songs on the CD. Everone should get this CD. It is a must."
711,Positive,Souless Pop? Not here,"When I was sick a few weeks ago my brother bought me this cd. Just one spin and I was hooked. What a pleasent surprise! I was expecting heartless trash with the ""lou pearlman"" sound to it. (remember o-town??"" This cd is definatly nothing like that. The main singer (Guthrie) wrote most of the songs himself. Along with the fact the group does not do choreographed dancing. (Is it me or is anybody else sick of that??) The ratings are out of a scale of 1-4Ohh its kinda crazy- 3 1/2No one does it better- 4 (great harmonies)I don't need anyone- 3Feelin' You- 3 1/2Faded- 4 (everyones fav; wassup sarah?)Lets do it right- 3Only in my mind- 3.5Stay- 4Baby come back- 3Gravity- 2.5Next Time- 4*In memory of Michael Cuccione of 2gether 1985-2001*"
712,Positive,Thank God,"I thank God for the writer of this book. This book explains new insight on Jesus' parables, taking in consideration of the Lord's geographical location and culture.It took me a while to read this book. Why? Because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it. Its not something that you read and let bygones be bygons.This book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as Jesus' followers. It addresses issues like greed or Me-society that we often ignore. I'd like to stress out that Jesus pointed everything plainly for us. This book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if God is really what motivates us in everything we do.I love this book and will give it to friends I know. Please pray for me so I can share it to others as well, and also put the Jesus' words into action.Thank God."
713,Negative,getting tired of the cliche,"Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy, you are taking Anatomy 101, and believe me, this movie doesn't help you pass that class!). Many scenes are too dark to tell what happened. Hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen, and the next thing you know, someone has dropped. It is okay to see it for free, but not worth it when you pay for the ticket."
714,Negative,shameful ripoff,"even in the hour plus ''build-up/charactor developement''.i guess talky,anti american ''horror'' movies is the latest trend.i was watching the talky trailer on my computer and got sleepy."
715,Negative,"Great movie, horrible DVD!","Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film."
716,Negative,How STUPED can you GET!,"I'll tell you how stuped you can get, this movie is how stuped you can get. This is one of the STUPEDEST movie I have ever seen and trust me I've seen alot of movies.The whole movie is dumb exspecailly the actors.I recamend you not see this movie actshoally I more than recamend you I BEG you not to see this movie But if you incest to I recamend you borrow it from a friend your if you can't, rent it at the cheapest place you no before wasting your money on buying it. But if I were you I won't wast my money at all."
717,Positive,Mighty Ducks rulz,This is a fun movie for children. My sons watched this too many times when they were 4-6 years old and I am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey. I know that sounds corny but it is true. My oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school & club. Good clean movie. I bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game. Hopefully it will impact them like it did ours. GO DUCKS!
718,Negative,What's this?...,"When i first heard his single ""One Wish"" i thought this is a good tune, but then he got to the second verse, i thought eh? This guy cant sing! later on his album came along, his vocals destroy his tracks, literally. Comparing him to other artists such as Mario or 112, you'll realize that he can't sing, full stop. Disappointing."
719,Negative,raydiation,"Thank God he stopped rapping, but now this album sucks too! Glad it was free. He's reppin' Cali too- oh hell no! The crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like R. Kelly and Timberland and they did him wrong! There are only three tight songs numbers 3, 4 and 5, all were produced by Rodney Jerkins, he can't be his sister though, this album proves Ray J just ain't got it, maybe he could if he had just stuck with using Rodney Jerkins. But the beats are not supposed to make you tight, your supposed to make that beat what it is and more."
720,Positive,WELL DONE RAY J.,"This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album, that album was good wit songs like 'wait a minute', 'where do we go from here', 'wet me' and 'formal invite',etc. However, this album is even better. You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy's kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: 'Exotic' - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. 'In tha Mood', 'Anytime', 'One Wish', 'What I Need' and the crunk track 'Keep Sweatin'. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like 'Quit Actin' - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. 'The War Is Over' - i liked the last duet they did 'another day in paradise' bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ... WELL DONE RAY J."
721,Positive,Stew,"Well I am.... I have to say in all honesty.... A true Magnum fan, In the past I followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best, which was in my own personal opinion...All the time ! Vigilante is certainly one of Magnum`s finest example`s of good solid heavy rock on any one given Cd ! ""Need a lot of Love"" is one of there finest along with ""Vigilante"" of coarse ! And there is also track`s like ""Lonely Night"" and ""Midnight"" on there too ! I personally have all Magnum`s Cd`s as I`m so into there genre of music and culture ! I Simply could`nt be without ! But if you like a bit of Live in concert Magnum then i recomend that You get you`re hand`s on Magnum`s ""Live"" cd !"
722,Negative,don't waste your money,"I love historical novels, and that's what I thought this book was, with the added bonus of naughtiness. What I got was a book with stories (I read 3 of them before I gave up)that had to be written by horney 13 year olds. This single purchase has me rethinking my loyalty to Amazon."
723,Positive,Brilliant reinvention,"Bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel. It's not a sequel to A Christmas Carol, as some readers assume. It's a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material, slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your Dickens, but in no way detract if you're just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thriller.Remarkable. Definitely a writer to watch."
724,Negative,Contrived -- SPOILER ALERT,"This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The ""mystery"" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying."
725,Negative,Too bad it's boring,"The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn't care less about Tim. The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat."
726,Positive,carnivale,"Wow the whole show was entertaining. It felt like you were in heaven just dancing to the beats along with Ricky, the dancers and the band. The whole concert was great and really entertaining, it felt so much like Carnivale."
727,Negative,"Once again, a great book chopped up like onions.","At a wimpy 85 minutes, so much is left out that unless you've read the book, a lot of what is happening probably won't make any sense.Avoid the movie, but definitely read the book by my favorite author Douglas Kennedy"
728,Negative,Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb,"After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb, I eagerly awaited the latest book from Lene (I also lived in and speak Danish -- an added bonus). However, I found Lene's chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such. For gaining insight into the state of mind for Lene, it was interesting. For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy, stick to the other 2 books."
729,Negative,Don't bother!,"This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is."
730,Negative,This is not a book about climbing Mt. Everest...,"...it's about being ""proud of being the first Danish woman to do so"" - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady, definitely NOT recommended"
731,Positive,Best Show Around,"Even if you don't like this programme (how could you not???), it's worth buying simply to watch George Eads the whole way through. He's so hot. The combination of a good cast and interesting (if not often creepy) storylines, keeps me watching this show each and every week and I could watch all of these episodes over and over. Go out and buy this now. It will get you hooked."
732,Positive,cj,It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.
733,Positive,"This is a great game for rookies, champs, and bored kids!","This game is fun, exciting, and easy to learn how to play. I got this for Christmas last year, and I still love to play. Trust me, I have a very short attention span and a complex mind and found this game great.Pros:*cool monsters to raise*tournaments to win*many secret breeds to unlock*many tasks to accomplish*lots of monsters to pick from*challenging for pro gamers*enjoyable for untalented gamers*rules aren't confusing*good graphicsCons:*people talk a lot*monsters only have 4-5 year life spansThis game is varied so that a variety of people can enjoy. At first it is Ahhh,uhhh, okay. Then once you understand, it becomes great fun.I had this game in fifth grade and my friend and I shared so much laughter and good memories. This is a good game for anyone, so try it."
734,Negative,From the biggest CULT of all!,"So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?"
735,Negative,Pro?! Huh?,Not detail in explaining conceptsToo few numerical examplesContent far too simple to be a desktop ref. in the dealing rm.Poor editing and formatting90% similar to the earlier edition.
736,Positive,"Good, but not great","When I first heard this album I loved it. After listening to it more closely, I still like it a lot, but am not quite so blown away by it. When it first came out, it might have been groundbreaking, but so much has happened since in the world of technical/avant-garde metal, that much of this album now sounds a little tame. The material hasn't aged very well. There are a couple of truly great songs in the middle-- all of the others are definitely good, just not mind-blowing (as some of the material on their older albums still is). The new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band-- a great improvement over Snake, in my opinion. If you want a truly great album, though, get their next, ""Phobos."""
737,Negative,I gave it a try...,"Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original, but in this case that's not necessairly a good thing. If you're not familiar with this band, this probably wouldn't be the best album to start with."
738,Negative,Does not work on Windows XP!,"Beware. This game does not work with Windows XP. The vendor said that it would work on any XP Version except Media-Center, but I have XP Pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution. I suspect that it's like another game we purchased that worked fine when XP first came out, but Windows Auto Update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old Win 98 games like this.We have it up and running on an 11 year old laptop with Win 98 , but it's too CPU intensive to run properly on that old thing.The game seems OK for the right PC and operating system though..."
739,Positive,"if you love cats,get this!!","I have had this book for awhile,now,and the only thiong I dont care for are the colored charts...I just cant do them,as a LOT of people cant,especially the older we get. I have a ginger tabby named Sassy who looks just like the cat on the cover...she is draped over a sofa....having that piece will forever remind me of her after she is no longer here to drape over the couch.....You wont be disappointed if you can get by the colored charts. In fact I gave it 4 stars because of the colored charts...."
740,Negative,terrible,Unable to use on my television. Advertisement didn't advise me that it needed a special television to play this game.
741,Positive,Hope may be a wrong concept.,"I wonder, does a person have be seriously ill to write such a powerful book like Orwell did... He had no hope and he imagined all world in his situation. That's very interesting"
742,Positive,A timeless classic that's an unforgettable must-read.,"This is the timeless classic which the term ""Orwellian"" and""Big Brother"" are derived. This terrifying look into apossible future in which the Government ""Big Brother"" holdstotal control over the populace. Orwell's vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a must-readfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental control.-Hans Chen"
743,Positive,1984,"Orwell's futuristic 1984 was a pleasure to read. The detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest Winston and Julia. The paper weight symbolizes the end of Winston and Julia's private and secure existence, which allow them to be safe with each other. They found refuge in the small apartment where they could be themselves without ""Big Brother"" watching their every move, it's ironic the government was still able to scrutinize every moment of their lives. I enjoyed reading this novel. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Orwell."
744,Negative,1984,"1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don't really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one, unless your into this type of genre. I give this book 1*."
745,Negative,Not a helpful history book AT ALL,"I was doing a research paper on the year 1984, and according to my teacher, NONE of this actually happened.I got a flippin' F.Last time I ever read a history book by this Orwell scrub.He doesn't know a thing about the 80s.Not ONCE did he mention Def Leppard or Karma Chameleon.I gave my copy to a donkey.He said it was about communism.Ass."
746,Positive,TEACHERS??,"I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son, because no one can be considered well read without this in one's history."
747,Positive,"If you haven't read it, you owe it to yourself","I just read this for the first time at 28. Wow, what an eye opener. The things Orwell predicted in 1984, such as the technology, is amazing considering how long ago it was written. The politics are messed up by current standards, but frighteningly possible. The tense mood of the book draws you in, and there are moments (especially near the end) that would be truly terrifying to experience. The chapter with ""Room 101"" I read with a shudder.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it bogs down a few times. I understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be, but a slow start to any book is rather annoying."
748,Positive,Scary!,"George Orwell's prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes; You'd see it too, if you got off the TV and started paying attention to politicians and the laws they're passing.I hope there is a revolution of some sort before this grim forecast is played out to the end."
749,Positive,disturbing and relevant,"I'm surprised that Noam Chomsky hasn't been mentioned in any of the 299 previous reviews. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant, because the phenomena identified by Orwell (doublethink, newspeak, etc.) are, in various forms, actively used today in even the freest societies. Chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this. ""I've repeatedly found,"" he says, ""that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated, I can skip lots of the background ... because it's already obvious and taken for granted by everyone."" Curious?"
750,Positive,The greatest work of the 20th Century,"What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read, which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in."
751,Positive,Orwel Rolls in His Grave,"This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950's I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda, how the government watches the people, listens to the people.. this book is good if you care about the world. this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it. this book is good if you are someone who doesn't want to be controlled or fooled.kindof like the way we are today sadly.."
752,Positive,A Thoughtful Read,"Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else."
753,Positive,The title should be revised to say 2004!,"With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI, CIA, INS, and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases. They are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system, better not have anything to hide.September 11th accelerated the path that we were already on. I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment. I just hope that these ""mistakes, misquotes, and misinformed"" changes never occur in such a draconian fashion.Great book. Everyone should have a copy on their shelves."
754,Negative,George had a good idea but the book really stunk.,"At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that ""Brave New World"" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."
755,Positive,two plus two makes FOUR!!!!,"George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought, emotion and action would be monitored by the government.1984 tells the story of Winston living in a socialist country, feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel.Orwell is able to convey the helplessness of Winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences. However, as the plot thickens Orwell extends the sentences conveying Winton's hope and rebellion.1984 is truly captivating and rather depressing. As I read I saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but I couldn't put this book down."
756,Positive,A Very Interesting Read,"At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read, It was assigned to me as an English project I.S.U (Independent Study Unit) so like every kid in high school I started to dread it. As I started to read though, the story started to get better and better. There were points where I just wanted to continue reading and not put it down. The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like. Although at the beginning it does start out very slow, it is a very good read.If you read this book and enjoyed it, also take a look at ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley. It is quite similar to ""1984"""
757,Positive,Let's not pat ourselves on the back that this didn't happen.,"I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back, it is a truly great book. Like many of the enduring works of Science Fiction, its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into. Big Brother, The Two-Minutes Hate, Room 101 are all here. What's scary is how some of this seems to be coming true - but Big Brother isn't so much the government as it is Corporations. Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us ""We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!"" they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. ""We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears."" Orwell would've been so proud."
758,Negative,Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...,"OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card."
759,Negative,1984,"I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up, I fell asleep. I had to read it for school, and it took forever to get here when I ordered it. Barely finished it in time."
760,Positive,masterpiece,"I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother. Thought crimes. Room 101. It fits perfectly. Of course, whether that was Orwell's intent I don't know (though he was an atheist), but I think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"
761,Positive,1984 as true today as in 1948,"For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future, and could never happen, I would just ask you to look at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union from a historical perspective. But, then again, there are 2 billion people in China who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have. Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo). Children please read the newspaper once and a while."
762,Positive,I thought the book was great.,I thought the book was good to read. It gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to. I enjoyed reading it. I kept me in suspence.
763,Positive,When Already?,"Like others here, I'm wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable, laugh-out-loud sit-coms of all timewill ever be released. I bought Season 1 for a song when Borders went out of business,expecting a series I loved at the time to have dated badly. It hadn't.A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audienceI quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I've pre-ordereda box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released. When already? Ever?"
764,Negative,Might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries.,"I always rely on Amazon customer reviews - this is the first time I have been so completely disappointed. I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air, and that was with the fan on High. Due to the size and shape of the fan blades, no air comes out of the center of the fan; what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan. I won't comment on the light, since I wasn't interested it that option. Just got it, and I am sending it right back."
765,Negative,:\,"If I could give this a negative rating I would. I guess I was unlucky. Installed batteries, light would NOT shut off. I figured I would just ""break"" the lights since I only needed the fan. Well before I could do that, the fan went out."
766,Positive,"Like silky, velvet dreams","The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea."
767,Negative,He isn't what I remember.,"The CD isn't what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD , there is very little of his solo piano music. Very little grand piano type music at all. Most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music. I was disapointed."
768,Negative,Need to proof read your work,This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don't work. The book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors. If you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.
769,Negative,NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER,"hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip, i was really dissapointed, it wasnt even 3 minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get ON FIRE!!!! melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is VERY UNSAFE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DONT PUT YOUR BABY IN DANGER IF YOU HAVE THIS PLUGGED IN YOUR CAR, CUS THE WARMER MIGHT GET ON FIRE, MINE DID!!!! i hope this review helps you, i wont EVER buy this product EVER again."
770,Negative,Waste of money,"I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter)."
771,Positive,It is what is......,"West-West yall! This album is good for what it is meant to be, West coast Gangsta music. It's all about lowridin, smokin chronic, kickin' it and gangbangin in the Golden State. Those who are accustomed to Down South music will probably not like some of the west coast funk. It's a different flavor for some. Me being from Cali, I love this stuff. It is rare that someone captures the essence of the west. I do agree with this not being the best album but it's still worth buying. It's got enough head-bangers to get you to the club. That's Cali-4-ya.... 3 1/2 stars"
772,Positive,Erotic and Romantic... One of Anne's Best!,"Exit to Eden is one of Anne's Best works, in my opinion. Many people were turned off by the film adaptation (why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me <eg>) but this book focuses on the relationship of Master and Slave and what happens when the tables are turned. Anne has many sides and Lestat is just one of them. True Rice Fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction."
773,Positive,"Wonderful story coupled with steamy, erotic scenes.","This book was hard to put down. The story was excellent, and the erotic scenes were just as good. Like all of Anne's books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!"
774,Negative,Stick with Sleeping Beauty,"Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it's tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree. It's ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more, and turned into one of the worst movies you're likely to see. Ann Rice didn't deserve such treatment.There are books that capture the true essence of the BDSM fanatsy that are much more engrossing, and interestingly enough, Ms Rice has written them as well. (writing as A. N. Roquelaure, see her trilogy in the Sleeping Beauty series)"
775,Negative,Vile from the beginning,"Let me start by saying that I never put down a book, even if I don't like it. This is one that I couldn't even get past the first few pages. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book. I'm glad it was a free download on Kindle. I gave it two stars only because I didn't give it a chance to get better. If I hadn't deleted it, maybe I would give it another chance, but I certainly won't pay for it."
776,Negative,spirirt house. a boring bloody mess.,shame on me for buying it. shame on me for reading it. karen b. wisconsin
777,Positive,Spirit House: Read This In An Air-Conditioned Space,"Reviewer: Renee S. NYC. August 13, 2008The plot is typical Noir, the hero typical world-weary and disillusioned Hammett orChandler, but the atmosphere is stunning!It was a whole new world for me and I fellcompletely into it from Vinnie's first nightmare to the final dripping conclusion.Mr. Moore's descriptions of Thailand andthe Thai people are evocative and real. Onecan feel the heat and humidity, see the swirlsand flashes of colors, and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages. And the story's not bad either. I was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in Bangkok - and the story's not bad either. There were a confusing numberof characters, some of whom did not advance the plot at all, and the plotting could have been tighter, but all-in-all I would definitely recommend the book. Just be sure you read it in an air-conditioned space, because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat!"
778,Negative,I HATE THIS BOOK,I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!
779,Negative,Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at?,"If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published"
780,Negative,NOT THAT GOOD,Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.
781,Positive,Start memorizing this book.,"I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won't want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that."
782,Positive,dystopian classic,"Wow, what a great book about a dystopian society, censorship, and the need of the state to keep the masses blind, deaf, and dumb. If you enjoyed ""1984"", ""Brave New World"", or ""The Giver"", you must read this. It is now one of my favorites!"
783,Positive,really good,"this was a good book. the part called ""coca""is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like ""the giver"" only a lot better."
784,Positive,What a classic,"To be perfectly honest, I really don't understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader. Yes I know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages. Every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books, no matter what the content or agenda the story might contain.Anyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately. It's the best $.25 you will ever spend."
785,Negative,Didn't Like it!!,"Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? Come on. Burning every book that exists, this isn't a look into the future. It's a look into Bradbury's twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don't waste your time."
786,Positive,A book with many levels,"What appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books, with reflection is a comment on the systematic suppression of free thought and free speech. The book gives insight into how those who look the other way or are concerned with rights only as applied to them can actually further the loss of individual freedoms. A very thought provoking novel."
787,Positive,Fahrenheit 451,"I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D"
788,Negative,"Great Book to read, but NOT to LISTEN to.","I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD. Ray Bradbury reads it, and it is very bad. It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off. He reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep. Someone needs to re-make the CD's."
789,Negative,DON'T READ THIS MIND-NUMBING DRIVEL!,"This book doesn't deserve one star. It deserves negative 1000 stars. This was the WORST book I have ever read. The book moved to slow, and the characters are stupid. Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman who sets books on fire, becuase homes are fireproof. Then he meets this crazy girl nmaed Clairese who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like (Did you know that one time billboards were only 20 feet long, instead of 200) WHO CARES?!?! If there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this."
790,Negative,Hardly even deserves 1 star,"This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version, there is a forword and an introduction. Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?"
791,Positive,"Captivating language, needless to say amazing.","Being only a teenager, what I have to say usually means nothing, or gets no credit. I personally loved this book, reading it just a day ago. I was entirely captivated with the plot, and the idea of censorship in the future, and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable. What possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing. To actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing. I would recommend this to anyone. You don't need to love to read, just know how to read."
792,Positive,Ok,I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.
793,Positive,Excellent!!! My #1 book of all time!!!,"I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class, and fell in love with it. It's simply chilling in it's portrayal of the ""future"" and the deliberate ambiguity about Clarrise is very cool. The deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling. A very poignant book, it's definitely a must-read."
794,Positive,Very important book,"This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the ""dumbing of America"" that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country)."
795,Positive,It'll never go out of date,"I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It's absolutely fantastic and I just plain can't recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn't matter. I can say ""transcends the genre"" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?"
796,Negative,"Bleak, Blind, and Boring.","Being forced to read it in school for its ""so called""relation to censorship (sp?) I would have to say !!BURN IT!! Althoughthe book is about censorship and why/how it is wrong I can't say much good about it. The theme itself is good, but the story itself is trash. One of the most un-realistic ideas i've ever heard. First off, everyone in the country is an idiot. Second, that includes the hero. Third, even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence. And finally, way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itself.L8r."
797,Negative,"Fahrenheit 451, Burning Up My Brain","I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering ""wait... what happened?"". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound."
798,Negative,Sadly a disappointment,"Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did."
799,Positive,F 451 shows how dangerous a person's ideas are.,I enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme .look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think. An individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general
800,Positive,A must read - especially for teenagers.,"This is my first re-read of this book as an adult (I'm now 46). I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter, age 14, and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read. My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too). It is hard to believe that this book was written in the 1950's."
801,Negative,poor reading,I bought this book on tape as read by the author. It is excruciating to listen to. Don't get this! I should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author!!
802,Positive,Good,"Fahrenheit 451 is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world, instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe, firefighters burn entire houses containing books, and occasionally even people. One of these firefighters, Guy Montag, has doubts about the whole situation, and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan. The major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction. I would suggest everyone read this book at least once, to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance. I overall liked this book, and would give it a 4/5"
803,Positive,Explains a lot of things from the movie,"The book was not so good as the movie, but the book helps understanding some points that seemed totally random when I saw it.Compared to 1984 it's miles away, but still is really nice."
804,Negative,Fahrenheit 451,"This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced. It was very confusing, especially the ""TV family"" which I did not understand at all. It is more of an adult book."
805,Negative,Fahrenheit %0ZERO0%,"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray BradburyI didnt really like this book, it was all just people rambling on and on about how there life sucks, the whole worlds sucks, and burn books. I dont know how you could enjoy this book. People just talk to talk in this book. Its about a guy named montage that is a firefighter. He burns things instaed of putting fires out. He meets a wierdo girl who talks nonsense, this guy starts to think what hes doing starts reading books and gets caught. He then has to burn his books. He doesnt want to go to jail so he Runs away."
806,Negative,BURN THIS BOOK!,"Hey A reader from MISSOURI, I hear you. This book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school. I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years!!! I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won't have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!"
807,Negative,A Very Dark and Mysterious Book,"I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally, I hated the book."
808,Negative,I tried reading this book for my summer reading & it was bad,I am sorry this book did not make any sense and I am a straight A student. If you have a choice I wouldn't pick this one.
809,Negative,WASTE OF MY TIME,"first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class. it started out lame. and all it did was get worse. who cares about a firefighter who burns book. now come on, i could write a book, about books,ten times better then that. maybe if the books had names and talked then maybe it would of caught my attention."
810,Negative,This is the lamest book I have ever read,This book really sucks. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time. Ray should have had better things to do
811,Negative,Weird Weird Weird Weird!!!!!!,"This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring! The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV, but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the TV back on. I mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with 4 wall TVs, robot dogs, and burning books. And the story never really had an ending. It just stopped, I guess to end the boredom. I think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book. How else would it get on the required reading list? Maybe he gives 50% of the profits from sales. Please don't buy this book, you are supporting a lunatic."
812,Positive,real cranberries,"I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound, elegance, quality, essence, delicate sadness and youth. It is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post XX century pop music.I do recomended.(...)"
813,Positive,"INTERESTING AND SAD! , BUT VERY WELL DONE!","This is very interesting film that is really five stories in one. A dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another. A great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time. The film is ultimately sad and depressing, but each story is very interesting. With a cast featuring Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong?"
814,Positive,motorola phone car charger,product is great. works like it's supposed to. order processing and shipment speedy and efficient
815,Positive,It worked,Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
816,Positive,Well made product at fair price,I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.
817,Negative,Not so good,"It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places, exposing wire after only a month. My phone is telling me that I am using an unauthorized charger. So no, this was not a good purchase, and I do not trust the source."
818,Negative,battle weary,"This game is horrible. The battles are so... long, slow and unexciting. The scenery is cute, but alittle dark for GBA.Don't waste your money."
819,Positive,chalinging game,"this game is hard and I still havn't beaten it, and I have had it for two mothes. I reconmend for only skilled players play.DELTA 904thanks for youre time and patience"
820,Negative,Horrible Game,"This game is boring. You can't follow the story line, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand it at all. The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring. In the mines of Moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug. The controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to. I have bought this game and I do not like it. I would suggest not buying it."
821,Negative,why oh why does anyone play this,"Yes this has good graphics, Yes it has a kind of Zelda theme. But really if your looking for a game that fits the Lord of the rings best then get the Two Towers. Once you are used to that then get the The Return of the King. That is the best game of them all. Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have ! Please Gameboy dont let Vivendi Universal (the makers of this game) ever make a game based on a film ever again. They wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you. DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!"
822,Positive,The Code of Dusty Fog,"I have read the book and enjoyed it. It is not one of my favorites, but it fills in some of the story line. I will be rereading the book. I have all of the Floating Outfit series and am in the process of reading them in order instead of how I purchase them."
823,Negative,Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz,"I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she's so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character. Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy. The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further. That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character ""melts"".....pun intended. I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ... I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I'll get from the library."
824,Positive,I Kept Waking Up My Husband......,I was laughing so hard when I was reading this that I kept waking him up. I then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him up.This is a wonderfully funny book and I hope to read more books by Robin Wells.
825,Positive,High Quality For a Reasonable Price,"I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire. It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions, there was no leakage or fogging. This case absolutely works as advertised."
826,Negative,Hallmark of the disposable society?,"Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic. So, folks after 12 hours they are obsolete, and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last 10 millenia! Yay, hooray!"
827,Negative,NO AVAILABILITY,"My rating is for Amazon, not the product. I placed this order and just received a mail that it is not available. Why is the availability not updated? I still see it being available now. Very disappointing"
828,Negative,poor quality DVD recording,movies are okay but the video quality is poor.Is this a legit DVD or black market?They are watchable...but grainy.I guess you get what you pay for.
829,Positive,Interesting View Into British Culture,As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
830,Positive,Colin Firth...need one say more?,"Ah! Colin Firth...the ultimate, consumate actor in a variety of roles. A delightful diet of films...one a day plus a bonus for the week-end and one can have a film festival all their own!!"
831,Positive,Ones to watch over and over,Excellent classic style movies. All well acted with excellent stars. Will watch over again many times.Colin Firth is one of my favorites.
832,Negative,Sweet Revenge,This is the only film I have watched so far. This is not up to the usual British Cinema quality either in acting or content. I didn't watch to the end. Once he found himself tied up in bed I turned it off.
833,Negative,Not worth the great price,"Paying about $16 for this collection of 8 films could have been a great buy. I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite, polished, reserved, and mannered. With the exception of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down A Mountain (the only redeeming film in this collection; Hugh Grant portrays the real British style well) the makers of the other 7 have obviously visited Hollywood too many times and have drunk their Kool-Aid. The courseness, vulgarity, even offensiveness in dumbed-down run-on dialogue, babbling idiotic nonsense, and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual British polish. The 7 films that lack class and levity of the usual British approach obviously came from the hog-pen of the U.S. cinema trough."
834,Negative,Warning. I HIGHLY don't recommend this set!,"You would have NO idea reading the description, and looking at the picture on the front, but most of these movies have a rating of PG-13, and there's even an R!!!They are mostly about sex, sensuality, and the like.Yuck. I bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like Pride & Prejudice and Emma, etc...These are NOT the same. I threw the set away without even opening it. The ratings are on the back. They should be written on the page."
835,Positive,"Great card, better than expedcted...","Considering the price of this card, its hard to be disappointed. I installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of Windows XP. As I write this, I am watching an old episode of Star Trek TNG on a small screen on top of AOL. The capture feature works great and the the additional goodies...from cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional. I never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware, and the 8500DV was no exception. There is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install... I have found it reduces many hassles. Speaking of hassles, I have had none with this card. Windows XP is such an improvement for handling complex components like the 8500DV, I would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out Win 98 system. This card costs about the same as a prime 3D gaming card. It provides dramatic capabilities. ATI has really done a great job with this card. For the price....it cannot be beat."
836,Positive,Great card but difficult to setup,"As the other reviews noted, there are problems with installing this card, even though I got it working successfully in the end. Although it isn't my top pick for a graphics card, I have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my VCR and print my digital videos to VHS (yes, this is possible, although it is a bit tricky to setup.)I withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup. If the user manual would have been more comprehensive, and if the ATI website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card, the whole nasty ordeal of card setup (that almost all night) might have been spared."
837,Negative,same,"Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. ""12th rising"", ""brimstone gate"", but the songs off of Vittra all sound similar. I can't really decipher between them. Most of the riffs aren't capturing. It is hard to find the cd Diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already I can tell you that cd is better than Vittra."
838,Positive,Louie's Goose,"A good childrens' book, excellent for reading to pre-school aged children. The text can easily be understood by the 3 and 4 year olds in my library story hour as they identify with Louie and his most favorite stuffed animal, a red goose. The illustrations are great!"
839,Negative,Trite story line with poor recipes,"I was new to Guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city. But the story line was trite, even contrived. THe ""culinary"" part of the mystery included recipes that, while tasty, are hardly gourmet -- they mostly consisted of things made with Campbell's soup. Not one that I recall was indigenous to Mexico. At least it was a quick read."
840,Negative,an unusual writing technique,"Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, ""Ulysses,"" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, ""Finnegan's Wake,"" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume."
841,Negative,self indulgent tripe,"What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia;went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hoothIf I wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel, no one would ever read it. If they did, they would correctly assume that I am, in fact, a pompous erudite fool. And by the way, I know that there are a million academics rating this book that will come on here and tell me how completely wrong my point of view is. But guess what?--I don't care and I'll never actually read any of your responses. Save it for your poor students and old, bearded friends wearing tweed jackets with elbow patches.To the rest of you (normal people)--stay away from this book."
842,Negative,My farts make more sense than Finnegans Wake,"ye make a book, alas, how is life? Green Bay Packers. Sandwich? Baby. Eat the, President, lake.Like that prose? That is James Joyce. The king of gibberish. I made it up. But when he does it, it is a classic. When I do gibberish, it is not. Why?What the hell is going on with Finnegans Wake??? I don't know.Joyce must be the genious of gibberish.I don't get it."
843,Negative,Naked Emperors,"Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such ""intellectuals"" are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip."
844,Negative,Mad with Vanity,"That was how English novelist Evelyn Waugh descibed Joyce when he came to write FW, and the judgment is apt. The book itself is tripe; but the contortions Joyce fans put themselves through to justify it are always a source of amusement."
845,Negative,He's challenging us to doodle...,"I give this book two stars because it's the first, and last, book to tell us what we already should know...that we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep. Finningan's Wake reminds me of the canvas I've seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint. Any one of us could create the same thing. Why don't we? Joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass. If you think it's worthwhile (personally, I don't) do it. You could be the next James Joyce."
846,Positive,Nietzsche is NOT the antichrist!,"Nietzsche is not fed up with christianity, he is fed up with christians, and the people who distort christianity. Nietzsche is not the antichrist, he is simply the Messenger in a greek tragedy. We are the antichrist.""In reality there has been ofnly one christian, and he died on the cross. The Evangel died on the cross. what was called 'Evangel' from that moment on was already the oposite of what he had lived""antichrist 39Five stars for Nietzsche, three for the lack of notes. Also, there are many times when Nietzsche writes in french or latin and there is no note or translation.ps I'm older than twelve."
847,Positive,Pocket chart,It is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet. It appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it.
848,Positive,Sraight-up raw emotions...,"From a female hardcore lovers point of view: I have just got to say that Hatebreed is amazing. By far one of the best hardcore albums I've heard in a while. THis album is full of raw, true emotion - it makes me aware of where I am with myself as well as with others. Hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound - they truly give it in a way that makes me FEEL the music. It has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back. I would love to thank the band personally for creating and SHARING thier sound with others...and for inspiring me."
849,Negative,I didn't know Sepultura was hardcore.,"It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, when they now tour with bands like that. Its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna-metal band's, except without what little talent or melody those bands possess. This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura. I thought this was a joke band when I heard it. f you're really interested in hardcore, put down that jug of Weight Gainer 900, turn off your victory sampler CD, and order a Universal Order of Armadgeddon CD immediately. And stop wearing so much adidas, newjack."
850,Positive,Hatebreed is the god of all that is god about hardcore.,"Hatebreed album Satifaction is the Death of Desire has to be one of the all time best albums I have ever heard. I list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer. If you are looking for strong lyrics, strong music, and an awsome groove that you and your friends can kill each other to, buy this and never stop listening to it."
851,Negative,"Worse than ""The Quest""","The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins, right? Unfortunately, the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies. At least Van Damme didn't do the splits in this movie. Then again, that might have given the film a memorable momement."
852,Positive,"I liked it, but my dog doesn't.","I had bought one of these for my old dog (a large German Shorthaired Pointer) who had a horrible pulling problem. And it worked perfectly for him, and he didn't seem to mind. On the other hand I just bought one of these for my 10 month old Coonhound, and it also worked to stop his pulling. But he hates it! I can't take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast 3-6 times. I think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up, but now I have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him. Other than that amazing product in it's self."
853,Negative,Imitation Brand,"They sent an imitation; Holt from china instead of the advertised Halti, and it cut my dog's face! I tried contacting them, but no response."
854,Negative,Not good for small dogs like lhasas,"This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures, the collar slips off and won't hold as it should. And speaking from experience, the size is not the issue i.e. even a small size won't work."
855,Positive,The Wild Thornberry's Movie,"This game is so cool. I have only played it once, and already I would like to purchase it. It has coloring, puzzling, and even adventures. The only time that I ave played was when I was going to a DNA lab, and I had my GBA, with a not-so-fun game, so somebody let me play The Wild Thornberry's Movie Game, and now I would like to purchase it, once again to say that."
856,Negative,Disappointed,"I am sure the story is fine, but the disk is imperfect, lost my packing slip and need to call to return it."
857,Negative,stargate continuum,the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that I have bought
858,Positive,stargat continuam review by cvf,movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am REALLY HAPPY about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough
859,Positive,Very pleased!,"As a loyal fan of the Stargate franchise since the very first movie...I applaud the actors, writers and producers/director for a job well done!It still takes some getting used to a 'feature-length movie' vs 'made for television'; meaning I was so used to them getting right to it, that I had to learn how to sit back, relax and let the actors take me there.I can only say that I was very satisfied with this purchase and I have a little bit more of Stargate in my home...where it belongs.Thanks!DarrylCincinnati, OH"
860,Positive,2/3 done,"I am pretty happy with installment 2 out of the 3 that were promised. I have been to a few conventions and have shaken hands with most of the stars, but I have a ways to go yet, and so do they! I am anxiously awaiting the next one."
861,Positive,It's great to have SGC Back,"I hope we'll see more of this mini movies, though it seems for a story like that, a 4 hours movie could have been better. Yet, it's a fantastic storyline, exploring new ways allowing us however to see all of our favorite teams seens over the years while the show was on."
862,Positive,Above expectation,The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.
863,Positive,Video Review,"Length:: 6:20 MinsThis is my video Review of Stargate Continuum. For more video reviews, search ""MikePetel"" on Youtube. Enjoy!"
864,Negative,Great movie butt o grainy on blueray,I like all the stargates. But this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd. Other then that it's another great stargate film.
865,Negative,one time cooker,This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
866,Negative,The few standout tracks on this album are...,"1) The intro, ""soulstar.""2) ""youloveme,"" which should have been the first single, not ""forthenight.""3) Somewhere between ""momentinlife"" and ""thereason.""Otherwise, a less than stellar album."
867,Negative,Soulstar - - Not Quite There Yet!,"I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn't there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player, and he couldn't even give you five minutes to really get into it. The other songs sound as if he was going off into left field. Now only if he could JustgivemeawholealbumIcouldlistentoo!"
868,Positive,This cd is really cool..give him a break,"I love Musiq ( even when he had the Soulchild, don't get me wrong all the songs aren't hits BUT for the most part he is doing his thing on this album. Cut my man a break, he is trying and I look forward to his new album. I love his voice, his music and him in general. The tracks that are my fav's are:InfatueightiesWhoknowsFortheNightYouknowyoulovemeMomentinlifeWomanopolyBuy, borrow(from a friend or Library) this Cd it's mellow like the way Neo-soul is supposed to be.Toodles,"
869,Positive,Jusbeautiful,"At first I didn't really care for this album, but after a couple of listens, I love it. Neo-soul is here to stay and Musiq is the greatest. My favorite tracks are Womanopoly, Babymother, Who Knows, and so on. This cd is hot and I can't wait for the next one."
870,Negative,ultimately ineffective,"This is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer isn't talented enough to pull off what she's set out to do. Sad, since I was looking forward to reading this, based on the jacket copy. Oh well. This reviewer recommends that others look elsewhere for a compelling read."
871,Positive,Run Lola Run,"This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen. If you are thinking about buying it just do so, you will not be disapointed."
872,Positive,What if!,"This IS your bag:If you like action, fun, stunts, thrillIf you want to see something completely uniqueIf you are not afraid of timeblendsIf you like fabulous music from some of the hippest german people (that make look the far too streamlined usual scores look veeeery old)If you like cartoonsIf you like to rather sit and hold than to stop the vcr and go to toiletIf you like to experience sheer SPEEDSo, what are you waiting for? Run to get it!One funny sidenote: The movie's rating was for 12 years in germany. Americans are really funny with their prudery. It seems that the americans are as afraid of sex as the germans are of violence."
873,Positive,My favorite movie ever,"this movie is simply the best i have ever seen. i am very into film, but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line, a great art direction, and wonderful camera work...all out A++++movie...everyone should have it!"
874,Negative,A bit overrated. . .,"Actually this isn't really even a movie, it's a really long music video. Maybe it's an advertisement, I don't know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the ""alternate-scenario"" theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point. Is there a point? Somebody please enlighten me."
875,Positive,Achtung!,"This movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath. Once just wasn't enough in the theater. I just had to see it again on the big screen. I never used to be into movies with subtitles. But the effect just isn't the same as it is in its native tongue. Just when I thought it's over, it just takes you on another turn and another and another!!! If you like fast paced, unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove, this one's for you."
876,Positive,Good for Hip and Knee joints in my Bichons,"This product is palatable and seems to work well with my Bichon, who injured her knee in a tussle with my younger Bichon. The joint works well and she seems to not have anymore pain. I recommend this product."
877,Positive,RELLY CHALINGING.,RELLY QUICK action you can play tag here is how to play tag youhave to tag all the othere cars wethowt being tagd in retern.batell is a chalinging game you fite. you can race to.
878,Negative,Just another excuse to make money,"I am sorry but after reading this book, I have to admit that the feminists are right. Men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money.The book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet. It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible. In fact I doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate, it would be inspite of the tips not because of them.An entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women, though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types, then the list over 10 to watch out for.I am glad I did not actually pay for this, I would have demanded my money back."
879,Positive,10 stars!,"This album is brilliant! If you buy it, I guarantee it'll be the best album you buy all year!"
880,Negative,Disappointing,"This was a very disappointing purchase. The 'Premium Hand Decorated Exotic Wooden Tea Chest' appears to be pine decorated with printed paper. Although the print is very nice, the description of it is a bit overblown.The tea inside was okay. Some of the combinations of flavors just didn't go well together, and often drowned the flavor of the tea."
881,Positive,Thank goodness for Amazon!,"My cable was out, and I missed my favorite shows. Thank goodness for Amazon where I could watch them and not worry about viruses or signing up for a monthly fee. Thanks!"
882,Positive,Joshua & Children,"This is an easy reading, but profound, story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders."
883,Positive,"Nice CD, but mislabelled","This CD is not Touch Sampler 5, which has not yet been released. This is Touch Sampler 00, released to commemorate the millenium. It's a nice CD, and the track listing is right, but the product title is incorrect. See [...]"
884,Positive,Colleen - Colleen Et Les Botes À Musique,"I can't imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern, and it doesn't deviate from that at all. But Colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again. By mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their re-processed and synthesized counterparts, she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism. ""What's is a Componium, Part 1"" goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end. And even it ""Charles's Birthday Card"" relies solely on iterations of Pop Goes the Weasel, ""Will You Gamelan For Me?"" is its own creation immediately. The tinkling comes fast and furious on ""What's is a Componium, Part 2,"" a track that sparkles like moondust. ""Calypso in a Box"" shows off the more processed side, and has an almost Senor Coconut feel for its short running time. The standout piece here is the final track, ""I'll Read You a Story,"" which appeared on an earlier album, but is always welcome anywhere."
885,Positive,McDuffie's elegance and artistry are marvelous.,"I knew nothing of Robert McDuffie until I heard him perform the Mendelssohn Concerto at Wolf Trap with the National Symphony. That performance led me to seek out this CD, and McDuffie's playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance. His tone may not be as big as Itzhak Perlman's, but it is nevertheless exquisite (the phrase ""spun silver,"" though cliched, is apt). This is true concerto playing, the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra (and, by extension, with the listener). I definitely will seek out more of McDuffie's discs, and I hope others will, too."
886,Positive,"Great value, brute force","First off let me help you novices out there a little bit. Don't buy a video card because of its price, its hype, or its look, do your research! This card is excellent, it is blazingly fast, (it beats geforce 3), and it is a steal... BR>A key feature in the radeon 8500 is the programmable pixel shaders. Let me tell you a little more about them. Geforce 3, 4 and radeon 8500 all share them witht he exception with the Geforce 4 MX. The newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you don't have a video card that uses this, then you can't play it. The radeon beats its competition while being half the price! but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ATI and what seems to be ""cheating drivers""Pros:blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons:driver issues"
887,Negative,"Not a horror movie, a horrible movie","This movie personifies everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days. The characters are superficial, the plot anemic, and the special effects vastly overused. Liam Neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction. The house is possessed by the spirit of its builder, who hates kids. That is about it. A terrible remake of the original 1963 classic, which was the best horror film ever made. Get the original, and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot."
888,Negative,Absolute Crap!,"Okay, if you're a special effects freak, you might like this. However, there are much better films with equally good effects. If you're a fan of minor things like say, oh... plot, character development, etc., then stay away! The 1963 Robert Wise film is the scariest film I've ever seen, and the scares come from what Wise DOESN'T show you. The '63 version was brilliantly plotted and paced, with one of the greatest ending lines in film history. The 1999 version has none of this. Do yourself a favor, and see the '63 movie, or better yet, read the Shirley Jackson novel. The only reason this gets one star is because C. Zeta-Jones is just SO easy on the eyes!"
889,Negative,A Truley Horrible Horror Film,"A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that's scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it."
890,Negative,Too awful to be funny,"I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare"
891,Negative,Catherine Zeta-Jones trap!,"Is ""The House On Haunted Hill"" so different than ""The Haunting""? Both share the same failure. A great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good THRILLER. But this movie makes it no better than a poor picture!Good actors, good story but not well told with its poor suspense! The old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful!!!"
892,Positive,Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick,"If you like super-natural mysteries, then you'd like this film. It is technically a horror film, but it's really not that frightening (though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet), and as a result, is not for people that watch horror films for the fright. As a mystery, however, it is really quite good, and deserves to be watched over and over, just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end."
893,Negative,...and what a feeble haunting it is!,"No, no, no! What went wrong? Big-budget film with great actors, and what do we get? A visually appealing film with a completely flat Liam Neeson and a paper-thin storyline. Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a ""horror"" movie, is it?I just can't believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you're into ""stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive"" movies. Then you'll se how a proper haunting should be :)"
894,Negative,"Great - then ZZZZZZ - then EGADS, what a waste!","Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a much higher caliber actress, along with Liam Neeson's lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime.... almost as if the movies' set was haunted!The beginning of the movie has so much promise - you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise, you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer - then, and without warning, the silliness begins.It is as if you've been thrown into an Addams Family reunion - the story line starts to wander, the characters continue to wander, and ideas and solutions pop-up without a warning or explanation...To say a ""horror"" movie isn't believable almost sounds absurd, but this movie gets you suckered in, then throws you on the floor flat...This is a definite - do not buy, borrow or rent! Just wait for cable!"
895,Negative,Poor plot,"The actors in the movie are a great bunch, but when the plot is very weak, you dont get very much. I mean Liam Neeson! Hes a great actor, but was very weak in this movie. it wasnt scary at all, the the end of the movie was bad. There was maybe one scary part, which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump. That was all. I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies, b/c it was a polar opposite."
896,Negative,Catherine Zeta-Hipboots,"A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (""I've got the save the children!"" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible. Let's just put it this way: I just sacrificed 10 minutes of my time to write this review so that you won't waste 1 hour and 40 minutes of yours on this film."
897,Negative,Typical Hollywood pulp,"Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me."
898,Negative,EMBARASSINGLY BAD,This is the worst film of all time. The only amusement came from making fun of the acting. How they got Liam Neeson and Zeta Jones to be in this movie is incredible. I was looking forward to bathroom breaks so I would miss some of this movie. Total poop!!
899,Negative,"IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT","The Haunting with Julie Harris was so good--even better for its black and white medium, which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off-kilterness of the set. Why don't they remake ""The Wizard Of Oz?"" Now, there's a picture that could be made MUCH pertier with modern cinematography. The cheap set and old theatre-style acting throw a damper on what's still is a great universal story."
900,Negative,Sadly Disappointing,"This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title, it would have worked. The special effects (though good) were too much for this movie to bare."
901,Negative,"It may be a modern-day classic to some, but not to me...","This 1999 horror film based on the original ""The Haunting"", is creepy in some ways, but altogether, it's not really a great film at all. It has good acting, and the scares and pop-outs are clever (things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2), with an ending that isn't perfect, but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart. The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it's intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn't horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool. The complete storyline was pretty good, also. If you want some innovative horror from 1999, I suggest you get ""The Blair Witch Project""."
902,Negative,Poor re-make of a good movie,"I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie, but after I did, I wish I hadn't spent the money. The story is lame, the actors dull, and the story is so changed from Shirley Jackson's wonderful book, and the 1963 movie that it doesn't even deserve to share the same title. Forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older 'Haunting.' You'll wonder why they bothered to make a re-make, proving that newer doesn't necessarily mean better."
903,Positive,A lot better than the factory seat.,"The seat was a cinch to install. It took about 10 minutes tops, and it's a lot more comfortable than the factory seat the bike came with."
904,Positive,Great story,I bought this book and Alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago. I was so happy to have it to download and read again on my Kindle!
905,Positive,Please the parents and the kids,"Our almost 3-year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart, our 15-month old perks up when ralph is on, and we parents hum the tunes and enjoy the smart lyrics - even though we hear this music daily ! The music is rich and doesn't go stale, and manages to bridge the generation gap."
906,Negative,too small for a newborn,I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
907,Positive,book review,Book is packaged properly so it is not easy to tamper with it. Great that it comes with a CD.
908,Positive,A great buy,This book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time. My daughters score improved tremendously!
909,Positive,helped a bit,"studied the asvab few days before taking the test. this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test. the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab, so it helped me to study harder versions. passed with a score of 94."
910,Positive,A Surprising Find,"The composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the 19th century. Their attempt was to create an ""American music"" from native American sources of rhythm and tonality. I get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as I got the first time I heard Erik Satie. The songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh. Don't expect much in the way of tom-toms and movie indian harmonies. I love to find songs that go to unexpected places. I found that here.For a much more sophisticated review, search ""American Indianists"" and Fred Flaxman."
911,Positive,"5 for the 1st, 4 for the 2nd","While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, ""accidental"" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come."
912,Positive,Make sure you see Jean de Florette first,"This is the second part of a two part series, and picks up where Jean de Florette leaves off. If you do not see Jean de Florette, then you will be missing much of the background of this movie, and the context is important. For example, without viewing the first movie, the viewer will not know Manons background, what happened to her father, and their farm. The viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the Soubeyran clan.The quality of the DVD picture is avarage. The picture is fairly clean and clear."
913,Negative,Does not work with Minolta DiMAGE 7i digital cam,"I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC, but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam. I guess SimpleTech must be aware of the problem since their tech support e-mailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one, but of course I had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card, so I hope this might help some potential buyers..."
914,Negative,"Will Die, Don't Buy","It's very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this drive, 4 USB sticks, 3 SD cards, and 1 CF card. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache."
915,Positive,My favorite book of all-time,"I can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me, reading them in a bookstore in Albuquerque. Inventive, humane, human, magical."
916,Positive,Simply Superb.,"I have read this book in both Spanish and English I believe it is simply the best novel written in the 20th century. No where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one. It touches my soul with a something magical, creating the world of the Buendias inside of me. Someone once said finishing the book is like waking from a dream. I agree."
917,Positive,This Book Changed My Life,"Before reading this book,I had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting. This book is akin to beauty bound in pages, it is utterly amazing. I personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through. I couldn't put it down, it simple spoke to me. Rules to follow while reading this: 1.) Pay attention and savor, and 2.) Open your mind"
918,Positive,"Macondo, la capital del mundo","Gracias a este libro recien llegamos a descubrir que toda la humanidad habito en algun momento en Macondo. Olvidensen de las grandes civilizaciones del pasado, este pueblo perdido lo abarca todo, amor, odio, guerras. Y los Buendia son como cualquier ser humano de este planeta. Esta novela son de las que se leen de un tiron, no importa que afuera pase un viento huracanado como el que destruye al pueblo al final. Al cerrar la ultima pagina todos llevamos algo de Macondo dentro de nosotros."
919,Negative,Too Boring to Continue,"I only made it to 195 pages. The book is just boring. A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don't care about the characters. If you don't care about the characters, then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull. Like dusty butterflies in a catalog, their various lives are chronicled. It's a dry description of their adventures and I'm left with a ""so what?"" Maybe his dryness passes for sophistication, but this book left me cold."
920,Negative,Columbian family values,"Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilictions."
921,Negative,500 pages of boredom,"The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores."
922,Positive,my #1 book,this book changed me ... it changed the way i look at things ... the way i observe all the events in my life ...it wasnt easy to read at the beginning ... but this book helped me get rid of depression ...writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot
923,Negative,You must read this book!,This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
924,Negative,Emporer's new clothes.,"I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed."
925,Positive,U will never read anything like it,"I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic. It feels weary and long at moments, also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul. Must have."
926,Positive,One of the best ever.....,"I have read this book 4 times, and I can read it 100 times more, and never get tired of it. This is what a great piece of literture can do. This book has such unforgetable scenes, that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story, but takes over your mind and don't let go till you set aside the book. And even after, you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece."
927,Positive,A Haunting and Incredible Experience,"I approached this novel with reluctance. A friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original Spanish. I don't understand Spanish, but I decided to try the English translation. I was overwhelmed. For days I was in a trance. I could not and did not want to pull myself away from Macondo and the Buendia family. The words hypnotized me. The scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a masterpiece in any language."
928,Negative,lesson in the depravity of man,"As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
929,Negative,Could never read this book....,"This is what I think my problem is... I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English, I would sit there and say to myself that I loved the descriptive, but not the flow of the sentence. I am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews. It has been a few years and I feel it is well deserving."
930,Positive,Excellent translation of Marquez's masterpiece,"This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration, political upheaval, and social transition. One criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical, cultural, or social elements of life in Colombia in the past two centuries.""Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude"" (p. 199).Overall, a great read!"
931,Positive,great card,"This card has to be the bast purchase I've ever made! The grapghics are great, it's DirectX supported (a biggie) and is far superior to most cards of the same price. The reviewer who says it doesn't work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card. If he bought the AGP card, maybe he should try the PCI. Anyway, this is a great video card from a great company for a great price. BUY IT!"
932,Positive,The best discworld novel; for beginners or veterans,I've read nearly all of them and this is my favorite. Definitely check out the ones with Death in a lead role (like Mort for instance)
933,Positive,Pratchett I just love him,"the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books I have ever read. I almost have to read them alonme because I get the whole family looking askingly when I laugh out loud. Great stories, obviousl;y fantasy but so real. And if you love word play you will never find better"
934,Negative,I'll second that,I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version. There is no indication in the record. I was really looking forward to these CDs.
935,Positive,"Carrot, Vimes, Colon and Nobbs are all back to fight crime!","Carrot, Vimes, Colon, Nobbs are back. With also alot of new recruits:Angua, Detritus and Cuddy. What is the mysterious thing killing dwarfs, clowns and assasins? Is Vimes finally going to get married? Who knows?"
936,Negative,"Terrible product, did not work, and company unreachable.","I purchased this item for my son, and it did not work right out of the box. I followed all the terrible instructions, and it still did not work. I went to the Coby website for answers, and there was nothing there either. I then attempted over 20 tiems to contact Coby via telephone, and was never able to get through. I finally returned the product for a different bran. I STRONGLY suggest buying something else with a longer battery life. and MUCH better support and documentation."
937,Positive,Where are the other seasons?,"This is one of my favorite shows. I have contacted Sony for a release date, but I can't seem to get a difinitive answer. This has been out for almost 2 years. Please post a response if anyone knows what to do or who to contact to request the other seasons be released. I'll sign a petition if that will help!!!L.W."
938,Negative,Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable,"I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth. There is no connection between the middle-English and its translation.That was a wasted 5.99 USD for kindle version and a HUGE disappointment :( ..."
939,Negative,Beware of editions by General Books LLC,"Beware of editions by General Books LLCThey produce books by scanning (OCR) copyright-free material, but without any editing.There are so many errors though that the result may be unusable.Usability probably depends on subject matter, but the many OCR-errors make even prose an annoying read.Especially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbled.See the review of J.M. Keynes' ""A treatise on probability"" on this site which I bought but is useless, and similar comments by other buyers (on ""Vanity Fair"" by Thackeray; on ""The Italian"" by Radcliffe)"
940,Negative,Kindle version is very poorly edited,"The content - introductory notes, translation - is great. This is one of my favourite adaptations of the Canterbury Tales into modern English.The Kindle version, however, complete ruins the book. The printed version presents facing-page translation, which works great. The kindle version attempts to do that, having one 'page' after the other, not considering that due to the font-size adaptability, this doesn't work at all."
941,Negative,Aaarrrggghhh,"Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon, and a second disappointment. Perhaps I should not shop online. Regardless, it is a classic and, I suspect, not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it."
942,Positive,Cnnterbury Tales(Oxford Word's Classics),"This translation allows you to read the stories, which often are in poetry, with pleasure. I found the stories to be earthy, funny, but sometimes sad."
943,Negative,"Great movie, poor audio transfer",It is so incredibly disappointing that when such a fine film is released on DVD that the audio would be out of synch. Does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings?
944,Negative,Tedious and Self-Inflating,"I'm always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It's the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting. PASS."
945,Positive,This is GOLD!,Jenna Reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish. This young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording. Stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard. Fiddle playing of the highest order
946,Positive,Excellent fiddle,"I really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable. There is a good range of tunes, which fit together well as a whole. I think I listened to it about 6 times in a row when I first got it."
947,Negative,This Coyote Is No Genius,"The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches, not as bad as what you'd expect from Mr. Bruckheimer, thanks to the lovely and charismatic Ms. Perabo and a nice performance from Mr. Goodman as ""Dad""...still, a gal who aspires to write songs and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY. That whole Whitney/Mariah thing, yecch.The bar scenes have a certain energy to 'em, but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams (or personalities).Here's hoping the adorable Piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future. I will definitely be following her career."
948,Positive,Good movie + these Coyotes aren't ugly!,"This is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like. However if your boyfriend doesn't like these types of movies then put in the ""unrated version."" In the regular version the kissing/sex scene doesn't show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy. It's definitely a cutesy movie, but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching. Piper Perabo and the rest of the girls won't disappoint I promise!"
949,Negative,"The bar scenes were cool, but that's about it","I bought this movie because I love Jerry Bruckheimer movies. I should have just rented it. The only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes, all of which were shown in the trailer. That about sums up the good scenes. When I watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find Piper Perabo, I couldn't believe it! Perabo's acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me. Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded. I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling! I'm one of those people who like all kinds of movies, even some really bad ones, but this is one that I don't think I will be watching again."
950,Negative,Coyote Stupid,"This movie is so dumb... ""HOW DUMB IS IT?"" This movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative. Dumb, Dumb, DUMB.Did I mention that it stunk too."
951,Negative,Absolutely horrible!,"This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Cruel Intentions""). The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn't any good), and there's really no good reason to watch it. See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there'd be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it. However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie. What a waste of my time!"
952,Positive,Great Movie,"I love this movie,i watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie"
953,Positive,Stunning,"I bought this cd initialey by mistake. I was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it. It must have been God's hand directing me to this stunning album. I had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked. I sat there and let Shirley Manson's rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd. I went out immeadiately and found their first cd, which was just as good, but in a different way. That is what makes this a great band (among other things). THe ability to reinvent without loosing the soul/sound of the music.Two great albums. I can only hope that they grace us all with many more."
954,Positive,A must have. Not a bad song on the albumn.,"this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting, it my advice is to go buy it. go spend a measly 15 bucks to get it, its well worth the money."
955,Positive,Rocks. Best. Get it.,"Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can't stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also, this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too."
956,Positive,GREAT,Garbage rocks. Shirley Manson has a uniqe voice which is great. The music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.
957,Positive,the album grows on me...,"I bought Garbage's first album first and I thought the album was great, boasting good tracks like Milk, Queer, Only Happy When it Rains, but the sophomore album was even better. 'Temptation Waits' started out with Manson's menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like, ""I tell you something, I am a wolf but, I like to wear sheep's clothing."" The second track had a rockier edge to it, and then slowed down with 'Medication'. And then it was fun all the way till ""You Look So Fine"" which ended the album with a sombre note, like how Garbage ended its first title with ""Milk.""A great buy, almost perfection - you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest."
958,Positive,Shirley...yum,"Garbage is a band like no other. You really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album.This album is packed FULL of classic Garbage songs that can really give you the chills. The opening track ""Temptation Waits"" was very eerie the first time I heard it and I loved it. The next track ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for, love the lyrics too.A great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru Garbage. A word of advice though...don't bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fan...defienatley not impressive."
959,Positive,Shirley & The Boys Do It Again,"Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album, 1998's ""Version 2.0"". Another mix of crunching guitars, wild beats, groovy keyboards & effects, and the sensual voice of Shirley Manson, the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock, with such great, rockin' tracks as ""Temptation Waits,"" ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" ""Push It,"" and my personal fave, ""Sleep Together."" There's also playful pop-rock with ""Special"" (with Shirley tipping her hat to the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde at the end), the delirious ""Hammering In My Head,"" and the truly gorgeous ""You Look So Fine."" Fabulous music & production from a fabulous band, ""Version 2.0"" is essential Garbage."
960,Positive,Great show,"Been watching this show on DVD since I got it. It made me even make want to get season 8 in the store which I did. It's a great show, one of my fav shows"
961,Positive,GREAT,"AFTER RECIVING THE 7TH SEASON SET AND IT WOULD NOT WORK...I MADE A SHORT PHONE CALL AND HAD A REPLACEMENT THE VERY NEXT DAY...WOW, WHAT SERVICE....MY GRAND-DAUGHTER ALSO THANKS YOU!!!"
962,Positive,absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie,Disregard stories about how Hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true. Or about Redgrave's protest at the Oscars. Both apparently true (certainly the second one is). Just see this movie because it's simply one of the best movies and stories of all time. The script and acting are both top-notch.
963,Positive,Julia,"If you like Jane Fonda or Vannassa Redgrave you'll like this movie.The content is dark but considering it's WWII that won't be a surprise. The movie is touching,sad,and in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far we'd go in the name of friendship."
964,Positive,Review of JULIA,DVD arrived quickly and safely - good srvice would use these folk again. No problems encountered.First saw this film in the early 70's at a seaside picture plcae on the East Coast of England (Bridlington). Was charmed by thew story and the actors... Loved the moody scenery... The DVD reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable...
965,Negative,Glich Heaven,"I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend's and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that's what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one"
966,Positive,Wonderful flow,"What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I'll be surfing by summer!"
967,Negative,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !,"There are many better yoga dvds to choose from. As a surfer, there is no special ""surf yoga"" as opposed to ""regular"" yoga. Any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit. Peggy's videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury. It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community. A better option is Shiva Rhea's Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a ""yoga matrix"" which allows you to create your own unique routines. Most DVDs become stale after awhile, but the yoga matrix on Shiva Rhea's dvd (in addition to the 4 ready-made routines), prevent this DVD from ever getting old."
968,Negative,"Another Bogus ""How to be a better surfer DVD.""","This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don't need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout. If you don't know yoga, it's useless. The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it's great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga. In some scenes you can't even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the ""instructor"" says what to do. Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing. Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video."
969,Negative,dont do it,"If you know anything about yoga, do not buy this cd. The only positive parts is the location and view of the waves. This is more a novelty than useful. Honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipeline..Try Ali McGraw's Video for a great intermediate yoga tape."
970,Negative,no book key,"I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA, required by my profesora.It didn't have any book key... so now i have to return it. And just buy the one from the bookstore, like I should have done from the beginning.Also UPS was a day late, and didn't leave the book as I requested by signing the ""LEAVE PACKAGE"" form left by the delivery man. I had to go pick it up myself because I'm never at home."
971,Negative,Needs some modification,"This thing is ok. But realize, you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work. Therefore you need 2 people to blow out your pipes. When you are blowing out an rv, constant air pressure is the key. So, saying that, i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it. Now I just screw this on, attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and I no longer need to hold it in place."
972,Positive,Nigerians! An Industrious People,"When I selected this book I was looking for a book I could share with young children, ages 5 years and up, to give them a glimpse of Nigeria, its people and culture. I liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions/lifestyles in Nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions. For example, the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in Nigeria for such outfits. Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties. All in all, it paints Nigerians as an industrious people, which is what we are."
973,Negative,"If you love the songs on Noddy, DON'T BUY!!","My son was very excited as we put the CD in the player! But when the music started, he was very unhappy!! The songs don't sound anything like the ones on the show. The melody and pace are different- and the performers aren't interesting. DON'T BUY if you are familiar with the 'REAL' songs."
974,Positive,Nice Experience.,"This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou's music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on, I knew I would like my favorites, Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side, but I found myself enveloped in the other songs, which I had never heard before. I was a casual Lou Reed Fan.I think if I liked it, then a real hardcore fan will love it.The video is high quality and the sound is great, it's like having a front row seat. I'm glad I purchased this one."
975,Positive,A rebuttal ...,"... to Jazzie of Hampstead, London. Don't know what you were looking at. Your last graf, where you make up some quote from Lou at the end of the show, is totally bogus. In fact, Lou says just the opposite. Pay no attention to that innacurate review. Lou has his good nights and his bad nights. This was one of the best performances of his career."
976,Positive,Native American Herbal Remedies,"So far I really like it. It's very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper. It's difficult to ""flip through the book"" and find what you need. But I am fairly new to Kindle so maybe it's just me. Or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand. But I do recommend it in whichever form you prefer."
977,Negative,blleeuurrgghhhh,"i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs, you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it's way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity. For kylie minogue i can find many uses - for her music i find none."
978,Positive,Dad is in Trouble,This movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer team.They switch teams without their mom nowing.
979,Positive,can't stand those male co-stars,I think this movie was great! I just couldn't stand the bad acting of the guy mary-kate's character liked. He seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking. yuck!
980,Negative,bad acting,"This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney, and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship. The olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch. This movie is unrealistic that Emma (ashley) and Sam Mary Kate were on 2 different teams. (It's a rule that siblings be on same sports team) This movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot."
981,Positive,Switching Goals - a very good movie,"Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie, but it wasn't as funny or had as good of acting as the others. This movie is good to watch a couple of times, but only a couple times. If you have extra cash though, I say get it. You won't regret it."
982,Negative,"Entertaining, but freaky",My son wanted this video so we got it. There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL. Maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is NOT real would be good.
983,Negative,Will bore you to death,Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
984,Positive,A good book,I really liked this book. The characters were intersting and the relationship Sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother. The book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the 20's and 30's.
985,Negative,Not happy,I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????
986,Positive,Nice suit.,"It is a great suit, great buy, great service all around! I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a Frosty suit to buy one of these."
987,Negative,Worst test prep book I have ever used.,"As other reviewers have suggested, this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn't already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious, but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time."
988,Negative,preliminary review,"I just began using this book to review for the GRE in April. I haven't gotten very far into the book, but in the first 15 pages I have already found four seriously misleading errors (and that's just the ones I've caught!). Some of the equations (even the Henderson-Hasselbalch) they provide are wrong. There is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation. You can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the GRE, but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks."
989,Positive,Wild Wild West,This is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The Best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
990,Negative,Isn't there a larger version of this game??,"This is too small for the age of child it's designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus, it didn't survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke."
991,Negative,Disappointed,"My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However, after 2 rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down. Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I. Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one."
992,Negative,It's great when it works,"I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well, after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth. Not too much fun there. I feel I wasted my money."
993,Positive,the bad quality doesn't ruin the concert,"yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert, bad quality or not. I'm only 16 and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity. I believe the Ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting, adrogyny is the only way to go!"
994,Positive,Goodfun,"Imagine action films were 30 minutes long. There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or ""No! You go on without me ..."". All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill's book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory, fact and example which is the style of O'Reilly's authors. This book cuts to the chase, and it works.You see, Tomcat is a servlet runner. It isn't that interesting or even the best of breed (Jetty is way better). Tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it, and Goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodies.Its a bit like a night tour of Naples on the back of an Italian cigarette smuggler's Vespa. Somehow, at the end, despite not having understood much, you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your own.Take it or leave it. That's just the kind of book it is."
995,Negative,Borinmg & dumb,"A waste of time.Glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world, and they don't.Don't bother, a nice tape to record over.And the last time I buy a film because Brandon Frazier is in it. Naked or not!"
996,Positive,Best film of the year,"One of the best films ever made, Gods and Monsters works on many levels. It presents the many roles men play -- gay/straight, husband/bachelor, parent/child, lover/monster, youth/elderly, whitecollar/bluecollar -- wrapped in a captivating story. Listen for the music; it's hauntingly beautiful."
997,Positive,See this movie just for Ian McKellen's performance!,"Gods and Monsters is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"". The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellan in the lead. I thought it dragged in a few areas, but on the whole it was a great movie."
998,Positive,best screenplays have more stability,"One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen's anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that."
999,Negative,Tree arrived bent and poorly packed,"The manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed, and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption. I have no idea how this tree looked all put together since I had to repack it and send it back. Thankfully Amazon.com's return policy is generous and swift - they get five stars for service! In the meantime, it was a real tree for me again this year . . . I may try to go with an artificial one next year, but will not order one online again."
1000,Positive,A Legendary story by Robert Creamer,"Of the 200+ baseball books I've read, ""Babe: The Legend Comes to Life"" is my favorite. Creamer wrote the book while some of the old-timers were still alive, and this makes his story come to life. If you want to learn about Babe Ruth, this is the definitive book to read."
1001,Positive,A Great Book on a Sports Legend,"This book was excellent. The author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the 20th century: Babe Ruth. Overall, we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong 20's into the 30's.My only issue was that I didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death. I would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death. Plus I would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his death.Nevertheless, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan."
1002,Positive,This will make your install a breeze. . .,My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
1003,Positive,Great summer read,"This is the first book I've read by Meg Wolitzer, and overall, I enjoyed it. The plot brings three just-turned-thirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the 50-something mother of their recently deceased friend. Wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters, their various flaws notwithstanding. She also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much. The strongest character is the Mother, Natalie, who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction, and by no means a mere caricature. My only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones. But in fairness to Wolitzer, in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters, and it's only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all."
1004,Positive,Gripping Novel About the Loss of a Child,The novel is a wrenching page-turner about a woman's loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live. The author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead woman's friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved. It is the best book I have read all year!
1005,Negative,"If I could rate it 0 stars, I would have!","I looked forward to reading yet another Meg Wolitzer novel, and I was very disappointed--in fact, I lost interest early on and never finished it. Some of the author's earlier works, such as Sleepwalking and Hidden Pictures, were excellent--what happened???"
1006,Positive,Helpful Start,Good book to start with; motivated me to get more books to read more about the nuances and subtleties about the game.
1007,Negative,Sooo dissapointed,"I got this book because it had such awesome reviews. I'm going to be taking a test in the near future, and you're allowed to use a medical dictionary, and I picked this one.I've been taking practice tests. On the first practice test I took, the first 6 out of 7 medical terms I tried to look up weren't in the book. I was stunned, and several of them were pretty basic words that I just wanted to get a very clear definition of.I'm not sure it's even going to be worth lugging this book to the test, or even keeping the book. I may just sell it and try another book.Jane"
1008,Negative,Material too flimsy,"I bought this bed recently for my 9 year old lab mix. He doesn't dig, chew or abuse things in any way, so I wasn't concerned with getting a super abuse-proof bed. But after a couple of weeks of limited use I found a hole in the soft side of the bed. The fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate, but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying. It may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials. Very disappointing."
1009,Negative,Disappointed,"I love this video unfortunately it doesn't show on a Blue Rays DVD player. Which means I can't enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated. However, other purchases in the past have been great through Amazon."
1010,Negative,Looks & feels like a bootleg product.,"My copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture! Talk about lousy merchandising. No Dolby, much less DTS, only a PCM Stereo recording. Video is average. Like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthought.All in all, this looks like a bootleg edition. And no, it's an official release. Amazing. Messy. What were they thinking?"
1011,Positive,Underappreciated Effort,"While even some members of the Bonzos give this album low marks, I personally think Keynsham holds up very well. Without it we wouldn't have ""You Done My Brain In,"" ""Mr. Slater's Parrot,"" the definitive ""Look At Me I'm Wonderful,"" ""Quiet Talks and Summer Walks"" or ""Sport (the Odd Boy),"" which would be a damn shame no matter how you slice it. While this did prove to be the end of the line (Let's Make Up and Be Friendly notwithstanding), there still seemed to be a lot of gas left in the tank."
1012,Positive,Awesome!,I Love this. My kids have so much fun with these. They are strong and hold up to ruff play. They shoot water clear accross the pool.
1013,Negative,A look at a distant past,"I found it interesting. It will be used in an adult ed. class. I will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems, how it reflects the times and how comfortable gabirol was in Medieval Spain"
1014,Positive,Excellent Translation!,"If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic and that the 2 versions I use most are the ""Good News"" and the ORIGINAL ""Revised Standard."" I have respect for the ""King James,"" the ""New King James,"" the ""Jerusalem,"" the ""English Standard Version,"" and the ""Holman Christian Standard."" I do NOT like the NIV or the NRSV. Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the ""Revised Standard"" and the ""New King James."" My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the ""Revised Standard."" But that said, the ""New American Standard"" is excellent."
1015,Positive,One of Clftons great ones,"I love all of Clifton Webb films, this one really extracts his serious side of acting. great film of the era, he is truly the one of the best actors of his time."
1016,Negative,PURE JUNK,"SO CHEAP AND POORLY MADE THAT WHEN YOU USE THE ITEM IT CUTS YOUR FINGER, EVERY SINGLE TIME"
1017,Negative,Poor example. The homework problems like hell,"The examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems. Never explain how to do bode plot at all. I am glad I know how to do differential equations before taking the class, otherwise, to use the method that taught by this book, I would be dead. They never explain well on those differential equations and the concept behind."
1018,Negative,Misleading title,"A book with a heavily religious slant. Anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that ""God has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires""."
1019,Negative,Propaganda,"As a Psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health, I am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book. For those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace, please do not invest in this propaganda. This book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering. This type of hate mongering, intolerant, uneducated mindset is what has led to many of history's most devastating atrocities, done in the name of ""God."" A basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients. Shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor. You are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering."
1020,Positive,Excellent information,This book was suggested to me by a counselor I was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction. We both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction. There is so much information in this book and I would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.
1021,Negative,Great Concert - Bad DVD,I have had this concert on VHS for almost 20 years and have been waiting for the DVD. I just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync. The sound and picture are about a second off from each other. Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD.
1022,Positive,Great deal on a fine subwoofer,"I recently replaced my 14 year old Velodyne FSR-12 with the DD-15. I did so because the FSR-12 was struggling in our new house with larger great room, and because the DD-15 was on sale due to its being replaced soon by the DD-15 Plus (at considerably higher price).The DD-15 is cruising in our new house. It really provides the bottom end that my Klipsch Heresies cannot. And it does not run out of steam at high volume, like the FSR-12 did.I am mainly a music guy, not so much into home theatre. The DD-15 brings music to life and makes the singers and instruments seem to be in the room with you. Everything you need is included, and the calibration software is a snap to use. The cabinetry is first rate. I got the cherry finish, and although I can't tell if it is really cherry; I would not bet money against it. It looks that good.I am quite pleased with Velodyne as a company, and I love my DD-15."
1023,Negative,This Book is NOT for NXT,"It's a great book. But the Mindstorms microproessor is now NXT -- it has been updated. Until this book is updated, you'd be better off to find a good book which is based on the NXT system."
1024,Positive,Practical Guide When Making This Challenging Decision,"No one can tell you what the experience of changing churches is like unless they have been there! This book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there. Much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough. When you study all of these essays together they are sincere, simple, and complete. This is a must read for those who are stuggling with the choice to move. The one knock I would make on the book is that sometimes it is not time to move and the book says very little about when to stay where you are. More detail should be given to the decision making process."
1025,Positive,Excelente,"Tego es la fuerza en la musica latina. Es una tremenda mezcla de son, salsa, reggaeton y hip-hop. Que estupendo!!!!!!!"
1026,Positive,definitely the best horror\suspense book I know,"Since you open the book you cannot close it,you have to go through, to dive in the horror, in the thrill, in the lush. Stephen King fans, please find ""Disturb not the dream"" by Paula Trachtman and read it once, read it twice then give it to your friends, this is the real thing, it is a must."
1027,Positive,why?,"This is a terrific recording. Rob Brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today. A keening, strident tone with an attack that is relentless; he takes his time building momentum and surprises with twists and turns but never loses his footing. When you play this recording it is difficult to do anything else but listen; it is that captivating.Lou Grassi and Wilbur Morris don't just sit in the back seat for this ride. They compliment the leader and provide idiomatic support all the way through.It is an amazing ride and one that I will continue returning to. Rob Brown is one of a small handful of players who always provides the goods. All of his efforts are worth investigating. If you can find this one, it's a real jewel."
1028,Positive,chuck,"This a good movie in the same vain as most of Chuck Norris's films, plenty of action, a must have for your collection."
1029,Positive,Memory Lane,"I saw the movie based on this book when it came out in the 70's and I recommended it to my daughter. When we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie (it never came out on DVD and I no longer own a VHS player), I explored the option of reading the book. I was intrigued when I realized that the book was written in the 60's - a bit of a cultural leap from the 70's, when the movie was produced - so I decided to give it a read. Although I didn't grow up in the priveleged classes of Manhattan, I was a teenager throughout the 60's and I could relate to the times. It seemed a little milder in some respects from what I remember of the movie (and my memory is not the greatest), but it was a thoroughly enjoyable read."
1030,Positive,Love these little smoker bisquettes.,I love the Bradley smoker and these little bisquettes it uses. It is so easy to use. We've used the mesquite and pork and chicken. It's all turned out great.
1031,Positive,the best kept secret anti aging creams on the planet,Have been using Exuviance products for many years they are the best. Its too bad they are not widely known. Everyone would look a lot younger!!! Exuviance should be advertising their products.
1032,Negative,Doesn't fit my situation.,My fault. I received it OK but it just doesn't work on my water heater. I must not have checked it enough. It was a bad impulse buy for me.
1033,Positive,One of the Best Romances I have Read,"This is the first book from Candice Porter I have read and I cannot wait to begin reading her other novels. From the minute I read the first page, I knew that this book would be original and hard to put down. The characters are believable and Ms. Proctor's writing is so detailed that you feel you are there with them throughout the book. I would definitely recommend this book - you will not be sorry that you bought it!"
1034,Positive,Underrated album,"I almost didn't buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others, but I took a chance on it, and I give it 4 stars. ""Put It Where You Want It"" is excellent, both in track one and the jamming version on track 11, and ""Roll With It"" is also excellent. There's no question that it's hard to beat some of Larry's finest songs. My personal favorite is ""Smiles and Smiles to Go"" and it's hard to beat his old album ""Discovery"". But if you're a Larry Carlton fan, I think 4 stars is about right for this one."
1035,Positive,lo mejor del cine español,esta pelicula es una de las mejores que e visto alex se luce dando una clase de road movie con gore al por mayor esta pelicula no es apta para personas sensibles esta al nivel de asesinos por naturaleza de oliver stone
1036,Negative,Well made but extremely skewed,"This BBC produced docudrama displays its roots - the British apparently cannot get beyond the fact that Wernher von Braun was the mastermind behind the V2 program. I can't say I blame them, that's human nature, but it must be factored in by viewers who are not fully aware of the facts. After watching this program, an uninformed viewer would be left with the impression that virtually everyone working on the American program was morally, intellectually and patriotically inferior to their Russian counterparts.Viewers will probably enjoy the drama but should take it cum grano salis."
1037,Positive,Well worth watching,"The Space Race wasn't quite as one sided as one might believe. This series outlines the benefits of Capitalism over Communism but also shows serious flaws in NASA work to ""get man to the moon before this decade is out""."
1038,Negative,"Not one of Rinaldi's ""masterpiecies"", yet not so bad","Well, to be really honest with you, I didn't like this book. Personally, I though Ann Rinaldi could've done a little better. Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful, but the rest is kind of dull. At some points in the book, Emily, the main character, is lying so much to her Uncle Valentine and is being so selfish, it's like, ""okay, so when's she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done?"""
1039,Negative,"This was not one of her best books, yet not a failure.","This book is really exciting;from the first chapter only. I am going to be honest with you, because if I raved about how wonderful and exciting this book was, it would be a lie. It was written with appropreate remarks and English grammer, but sometimes storys just don't get you in the heart. This perticular one didn't. But there are her other books, which I would say, are a masterpiece!"
1040,Positive,An Aquaintance With Darkness,"This book was an absolute joy to read. It immersed you into the characters. You felt totally attached to them. It let me in to a new aspect of the Civil War that I had never seen before...it was interesting and definitely not boring. This book is what I call a ""people-y"" book. She forms the characters so that they seem like real people, with real problems."
1041,Positive,Excellent!,"This was the first book I had read by Ann Rinaldi and I loved it! I have read many other books by her since then. At first I thought I would not like this book because it takes place over 100 years ago, but I was wrong. Rinaldi draws you into the book. The main character, Emily, is very likable. She's not perfect. She has some flaws, like when she thinks her problem with her uncle is worse then when her friend's mother is arrested and may be put to death. The novel is also very historically accurate. Before I never knew grave robbing had been a problem in the 1800's. I highly reccomend this book"
1042,Negative,A story based on a song,"As soon as I had read the first few sentences of the review I immediately knew that the author had based this story on a song by Loreena McKennitt called ""The Highway Man"", from her 1997 CD ""Book of Secrets"". Since Ms. McKennitt is on of my favorite composers I had to read the book.Unfortunately the book did not do justice to the song or the woman who wrote the song. Did the author have permission to write this. I'm sorry but listening to the song is preferable."
1043,Negative,"Well, we couldn't get Yoko Kanno, so here's Yoko Ono instead","What can I say? This CD is pretty much everything the other Cowboy Bebop CD's aren't. It's pretty much either 1) Take a perfectly good track and ruin it by throwing a lot of drums on top (Vibert) or 2) as far as I can tell, calling a mediocre lifeless piece of electronic pap by the same name as a totally dissimilar but good track off another CD (4 Hero). Either way, the originals far outshine any of the pointless meddling done on this CD.On the does/doesn't include Vitaminless topic, I got this album by mistake. I ordered Vitaminless but what I got was a double CD of this and Vitaminless. I can't imagine a more mistaken pairing."
1044,Positive,Hawaii in a bottle,I love this stuff! I first bought in Hawaii and it made my skin feel and smell so wonderful. So I bought it online to bring me back to those great hawaii memories when I cant be there in person!
1045,Positive,Kinuko San is back?,"I have not heard this album, but for those of you who remember the ORIGINAL Priss from the BubbleGum Crisis, Hurricane should be on here! if not than it is not her best!"
1046,Positive,Comprehensive guide to ski touring in the Tahoe ares.,"My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded, but the route information itself is first class."
1047,Positive,Do your homework,"This product works great, BUT you will need a different driver (see Ralink website for it). I run both Xp Pro and XP 64 bit and I had some problems. This product did not work the same with both versions of XP without the driver from Ralink, included software had problems with my Netgear router. (speed was not fast or consistent.)"
1048,Negative,Una porqueria no compre,"Total porqueria de repente dejo de conectarse, veo todas las redes pero no puede conectarse. lo barato sale caro"
1049,Positive,Math made easy,This product was just how I remembered it when I used it 30 years ago. Yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard. But that is how it was 30 years ago and I did not expect anything different. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtraction.My children look at it like a computer and love playing with it. It gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction.
1050,Negative,Average Book,The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT). It's probably a better book if you already know Java and are looking to catch some of the finer points. I don't recommend it for absolute beginners.
1051,Negative,Some one has an EGO problem.,"I previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book. And I was quite annoyed to find that some one posing to be me, Michael G from Passaic NJ, said that I was mistaken for my previous diatribe of the book. I'm not sure who it was. Obviously someone figured that I was not going to read the reviews again. I'm not sure who it was.I still maintain that the beek is BAD. It seems that some one is trying to sell this at all costs. This makes me very suspicious of all Amazon reviews. Sorry :(MG"
1052,Positive,Legend or the truth?,"The Hound of the Baskervilles is a true mystery classic by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It tells of Sherlock Holmes and his trusty comrade, Dr. John Watson. This extraordinary pair has solved dozens of mysteries times before, but now come to their most difficult case. Years ago, Hugo Baskerville was killed by a monstrous hound. This curse of the hound has haunted all the Baskervilles who come to live at the Baskerville Hall. Sir Charles goes to live there, but soon is found dead, scared to death. His only relative, Sir Henry Baskerville, goes to live at Baskerville Hall accompanied by Holmes and Watson. All along the way, they are left mysterious clues that eventually help them unlock the killer. I really liked this classic who-dun-it because around every corner was a twist. It kept you guessing until the end and was really upbeat."
1053,Negative,for this particular edition,"Seeing as how Series 2 of ""Sherlock"" has yet to make it to the United States, I was hoping that this would be the script, or at least an adaptation of the script to a novel format. Sadly, this was not the case.I confess that I fail to see how this series (of BBC Books) distinguishes itself from the other (often free) editions, much less the compilations, available in the Kindle store. There is a new introduction by a member of the BBC's ""Sherlock"" staff and company, but that scarcely justifies the cost.The text itself is the standard text by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle which speaks for itself."
1054,Positive,A Sherlock Holmes Story Starring...Dr. WATSON!,"Well, you don't get much of Holmes in this story, and many folks either neglect to mention that or just don't notice. I figure they don't notice because it's such a darn good read. At first, it's TALK, TALK, TALK. But the restlessness left me with oncoming chapters and I became engrossed. Read it!"
1055,Negative,Don't waste your time on this edition!,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this particular Kindle version is broken: any passages in the original which appeared in italic type have failed to be transcribed, leaving large gaps in the narrative, especially at the beginning.Therefore I rate this edition one star."
1056,Negative,MISSING TEXT!!!!!!,"This review is NOT on the quality of the story. I love this book, however.... This edition is missing text. Whenever character reads out of a newspaper or other document, the entire txt of that newspaper or document is missing from this Kindle edition! I've no idea which version to spend the dollar on to get the complete text, but its frustating as this was my first download."
1057,Negative,Plastic limitations,"When I got the product and opened the box, the literature said that you cannot use the kind of shower head that has a valve that turns off the flow. This is because the filter housing is plastic and is subject to cracking or bursting if you turn off the flow downstream from the filter.That's the kind of shower head I have, and I like to use the valve feature. I really really wish that eGeneralMedical had said this in their (limited) online literature. And they expect me to pay the return shipping and a 15% restocking fee!"
1058,Positive,"Great John Wayne Movie, YOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","Its a strange size for my TV, but, its a 1948 movie, so its exceptional! I have wanted this movie for years so I bought it!"
1059,Negative,Disappointing,"I got this video on loan from Netflix. As a railfan, I was extremely disappointed in this. The show was nothing like I had anticipated it being like. And the host is just plain annoying trying to emulate Emeril Lagasse"
1060,Positive,My 5 year old is obsessed!!!!!,"Great video. My son cant get enough of this. Any child or adult who loves trains will enjoy this DVD,"
1061,Positive,"Rad! Or as they say in Dutch, heel goed!","I love Holland and the Dutch language, and my Dutch penpal sent me a tape with various Dutch artists. I love ""Dromen Zijn Bedrog"", which is a mix of sort of modern-90s music, techno, and a chorus in the background. Fast and energetic! I don't recall the other songs too well but this album is awesome. Go Dutch!"
1062,Positive,One of the most AWESOME books I've ever read !,"John Bunyan's, ""Pilgrim's Progress""has to be one of the most captivating books ever written. This book should be ""required reading"" in today's school system. From the verybeginning Mr.Bunyan spins the tale of a journey that is most fantastic! Thur perils unbeliveable he somehow overcomes tremendous odds ofcompleting it. But yet he does andthe rewards are magnificent. A MUSTFOR ANYONE BORN AGAIN!!!!!"
1063,Positive,practical guide to modern christian living,"in this book, buyan writes about average everyday things of the 1700s, and about the christian plight of that time. i found it remarkable how truth does not change '.'"
1064,Positive,Best Unknown Artist,"What a great voice and masterful delivery of material. Someone else wrote sexy with a capitol S but that is insufficient. I'm not a big jazz fan and I guess this is not classic jazz but some sub-genre that really turns me on. Somehow the instrumentation, which is good, fades into the backround because Christy's voice is so present and distinctive. I can't tell you how many times I've played this cd and chosen it over my favorite classic rock. Its a great album to enjoy when you're happy just being by yourself and also a very nice listen when you're with someone special. I'm so glad I found some other music by her and I surely hope there is more comming. By the way, it has a couple of cuts that don't feature her and they are interesting and don't detract from the album. Also, I read in one of her bios that she starred in an indie movie called Pants on Fire. You can bet I'll be watching that if I can locate it."
1065,Negative,Not as good as the other album!,"I was excited to get my Steppin' album because I loved the other album of Christy Baron (I thought about you). However, I was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to I thought about you. I was expecting more of Christy Baron's sultry renditions of real accoustic jazz but what I got was some sort of a synthesized versions. It's still a good album but it's nothing like the other one. If you can only buy one album of Christy Baron, don't get this one."
1066,Negative,In a word...,"painful. Neither Paltrow nor Beckinsale were perfect either, but this one was appalling.This movie is packaged in 2 cassettes, and I couldn't even make it through the first one. Where do I begin? The hair was awful (especially Mr. Elton's), the casting was awful (Jeremy Northam will always be Mr. Knightley to me), the costumes were awful (zippers, anyone?). I hung in as long as I could to see what they did with Frank Churchill, but I just couldn't go on. So sad...My feeling about a good adaptation is that it should make you want to run out and buy the book. I'm glad I'd already read Emma 4 or 5 times because this movie certainly would not have made me desperate to read the book. I probably would have run screaming in the other direction.I did like their take on Mr. Woodhouse though. Thank Goodness for small favors!"
1067,Negative,No ADA seal of approval,I have this toothpaste and the ADA seal of approval is nowhere to be found on the tube. It doesn't whiten either.
1068,Negative,I found this product for $7.99 today...,"I found this exact same product for $7.99 today at Walgreens. This is a sale price, however, even regular price is less than this. I feel some/many of the mega diaper packs on amazon are a good deal, but not this one."
1069,Negative,"Holds #1, not #2","The title says it all. I never had a trouble with #1 leaking, but almost everytime my breastfed son has a BM (which are usually somewhat loose), it leaks out the back or leg area. Perhaps it happens because the waistband isn't stretchy. I'm not going to buy these diapers again."
1070,Positive,cool!,"claudia and shea are both in trouble at school. If they fail one more language test, she may not past the sunject. so what they do is to help each other and that's where they become friends."
1071,Positive,Marlon Brando,"A good, but slow performance by Brando. The girl should be in future films. Mature Only."
1072,Negative,Horrible!,"Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least."
1073,Positive,"Well made, but depressing.","This is another ""artistic"" movie. The acting was very convincing and all the stuff they say about the powerful acting of Marlon Brando and the convincing youth and innocence of the one-hit-wonder girl that starred with him is valid. It was worth watching, but probably not worth owning. It's ultimately very depressing and doesn't really leave you holding on to anything. The sex scenes were pretty explicit, but not really anything you couldn't see in a 'hard-R' movie today. Buy it for the acting, not the story."
1074,Negative,Useless,The DVD will not play. It goes thru the process of downloading until the last point & then says that it is not programed for downloading. I would like to send it back for a DVD that will play.
1075,Positive,Another great book in the series,I really love this book just as much as the two before it. I just don't want the series to end because I'm enjoying it so much.
1076,Positive,The single creepiest film of the year !!!,"At the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated, let me just say that this was as finely crafted a scarfest since the first Alien film. Writer/Director Neil Marshall is to be commended for creating a first rate horror film that, for once, doesn't rely on all the hacneyed tricks and CGI effects that have come down the pike in the last several years as well as utilizing cast of unknowns who also can't act to save their lives. This cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably. The score by David Julyan is the perfect accompaniment to Marshall's film and the cinematography and editing by Sam McCurdy and Jon Harris respectively combine to make this the true jewel of horror films.I normally don't purchase films of this ilk but after renting the film and getting the bejesus scared out of me I just had to own a copy. I would therefore recommend this film to anyone who enjoy their shocks and frights at high octane levels."
1077,Negative,VERY BAD MOVIE,"This is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the 1950s-type phony monsters. A group of women decide to spelunk, with no ""flight plan"" filed with anyone. Then of course one of them chooses to take the rest into an unexplored cave without mentioning to the others that it could be is dangerous. With friends like that.....Then of course, in the cave, blind monsters (people in rubber suits) show up to murder all the women.First of all, why would such strong, fearless women in the beginning of the movie suddenly turn into cringing, screaming, and hysterical stereotypes.Secondly, the monsters are so badly done that one expects to see zippers on the back of their rubber suits.Steer clear of this movie. It is horrible. I was embarrassed for the filmmakers."
1078,Negative,Awful Waste of Money!,"This tape should be sold as an audio only. The cave scenes are so dark, it is pointless to watch; the direction is poor; character development doesn't exist. It is too bad the rating system does not have a choice of zero or negative stars."
1079,Negative,movie was a waste of money,"this movie totally sucks. i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money. the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened. the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole. thats it, the movie sucked dont buy it."
1080,Negative,"trash, i wish I could give it no stars!!!!!!","I love horror movies!!! But this is really a horrible movie, the gore looks fake and a lot of it appears to be cg although some real props were used. The actresses were very bad at acting, and not in that cool b-horror movie way either, they suck. I know tons of gore fans like myself may like this movie but its trash,THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT IS ONLY 90 MINUTES LONG!!!!!!Guess I will start having to go back to the Asian import shop for good horror."
1081,Negative,over rated,had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least. No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death!!
1082,Positive,This book is great!,"I used this book for an entomology class at my college, and I think it is great! Wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already, I still didn't find it boring or tedious, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails."
1083,Positive,"Presto, chango, Magic is fun...WE'RE DEAD!","I saw this when I was 12 years old and it freaked the shiznit out of me - low on gore, high on psychological thrils, MAGIC is an old-school horror flick of the classic kind - anchored by Anthony Hopkin's early bravura dual performance as Corky/Fats - but what I remember most about MAGIC isn't the movie, but the scary as hell TV spots that used to run back in the 70s on late-night TV - the bonus materials explain that after the simple, yet very creepy TV ads ran ONCE on TV in New York, they were pulled due to parental complaints about frightening their little tots - they're weren't far of the mark - as the camera pulls in and ""Fats"" intones his evil poem - ""Magic is fun...we're...DEAD!"" - you'll feel your blood turn to ice. A nice DVD to complete your horror collection - [...]"
1084,Positive,Creepy old Anthony Hopkins film,"Magic stars Anthony Hopkins long before Silence of the Lambs. His character ""Corky"" is a magician who can't seem to catch a break. He decides to try his luck at using a ventriloquist doll during his act and he becomes a success. His ventriloquist partner ""Fats"" starts to take over Corky's thoughts and motives. The success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with Fats. It is at this point that Corky's weird life begins to fall apart. He finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when Fats decides to take over. I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me. Just the thought of a doll coming to life is a bit disturbing. Great movie!"
1085,Negative,harassing bears?,"Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins,"" by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?"
1086,Positive,THE best book for AP spanish!,"This book is the absolute best buy for AP Spanish Language preparation. It goes through every aspect of the test and has a very thorough review of all grammar tested in the exam (although I thought that they had a little more then what was needed). The practice tests accurately measure with the difficulty and format of the real test. Having a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher, I picked up this book and used it for self-study. It helped me greatly, and in the end, I received a 4 just by going through it myself and practicing."
1087,Positive,"great lil printer, BUT","I bought this to replace my original HP 4L Laser jet after 15 years. This seems to do a great job so far, much faster downloads and clean print,BUT BEWARE.... IT DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD TO CONNECT, so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter (as mine did) be ready to spend another $35.00 for a usb cord. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
1088,Positive,good printer,"I have bought this printer for my personal use at home.It is good and reliable printer for the price.Somehow, it arrived with software instalation CD in a forein language which was a big inconvenience.The white color chose by manufacturer is a questionable. It is a white spot in a room and I bet for many households it can be a problem.Also, lack of any controls buttons is inconvenient to restart a job even after paper reload."
1089,Positive,A quiet workhorse!,"Bought this and just to test if I would keep it, I printed a huge database file of 16,000 pages which took me almost 20 hours between personal breaks and only five cartridges. The guide says don't do that, but I did it, and this 1020 printer did not fail once. Wow! (Needless to say, I kept it!)"
1090,Negative,"Great printer, unless you're using Vista","I like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars, but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running Vista. HP will not be releasing the drivers until July of this year. So if you want to print now and not wait six months, and you've already upgraded to Vista, I recommend getting a different printer. Hopefully HP will get the message and release some drivers. Vista has been in beta for a long time, so I find this delay to be inexcusable."
1091,Negative,1020 printer stopped working after few months,"I can't beleive this printer only worked for 3 months. I bought it last Dec, but only start to use it 3 months ago. Now it stopped working. Does anybody know this printer has any warranty? Thanks!"
1092,Positive,Excellent Entry Level Laser Printer,If you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executive's office this is perfect. It is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair.
1093,Positive,Great Read - Suspenseful,"When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down, it just wasn't grabbing my attention, but once I got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't put the book down. I could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did. Adrian Jenkins was confused and deceitful. All hell does break loose. Gregory's relationship with his mother was sad. I understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish. It not only destroyed Gregory but it also destroyed his little sister. I am definately looking forward to her next book."
1094,Positive,classic,hardly ever see this movie on tv..so i had to order..love it a must see!! went see it at the old movie house with my school when i was a kid...never forgotten it!!
1095,Negative,WHAT!!!,"Don't buy it. If Meth's new album isn't at least ten times better than this, then rap is officially dead, and the only thing that can resurrect it is a Bone Thugs reunion."
1096,Positive,A classic!,"Of all the albums we bought in the 70s this is one of my favorites! When I get in the mood for reggae I usually start here with 'Let my days be long' (or 'Revolution' on Marley's 'Natty Dread'). It is 'religious', as others have mentioned, but that shouldn't be a problem if you appreciate different styles(?) of reggae. Did I forget to mention 'Super Ape' or Augustus Pablo? Man."
1097,Negative,Design flaw prevents easy installation,"For a 1/2"" slip-mount installation, this diverter spout is not worth the trouble.You must unscrew the diverter's plastic nipple, remove a plastic adapter, slide it on the copper pipe, screw the plastic nipple back on, tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic, slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall, tighten the screw, and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape. That seems straightforward, but in practice it's very difficult.The problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit 1/2"" copper pipes longer than about 1"" from the wall. The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2-3/4"" long, but actually this is wrong. At first I struggled with trying to install it, then broke the plastic when I could not force it to go all the way in.I elected instead to go withMoen 3808BN Kingsley Slip Fit Tub Diverter Spout, Brushed Nickel, which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw, with almost no effort."
1098,Positive,Love old recipes,"thanks for compiling these recipes. They were fun to read, and although I am certain that I am not going to make any of them, it was fun reading them."
1099,Negative,I want to like this.,"The tracks are great.The playing (might be) great.The recording quality is wretched.I hate to say that, but it is that bad."
1100,Negative,"Shame on you, Mr Coffee!","Jeez, I figured you guys KNEW about coffee! This is a terrible excuse for a warmer. It keeps your coffee slightly above body temperature, not nearly warm enough to be pleasant. I bought two of them and am tossing them out. Anyone considering this item? DON'T buy one!!!"
1101,Positive,Great gift,"I was given this as a christmas gift, and it's more than lived up to my expectations.It won't heat a cold cup of coffee, but it will keep a cup at a very nice temperature for a very long time.Works best if you actually drink the coffee, the less coffee in the cup, the more effective it is... A full cup of coffee left for a couple hours will moderately warm, but if you actually drink the coffee slowly over time, the end will still be a good temp."
1102,Positive,Mr. Coffee Warmer,The warmer keeps the cup at an acceptable temperature and looks great on the desk. The warming light is very useful in reminding me if the unit is on or off. I could not be more pleased with this product and the cost was perfect.
1103,Negative,Mr Coffee mug warmer,I have used a Dazey and it worked great. The Mr Coffee keeps it a little warm but I like my coffee hot.
1104,Negative,"Warm, not hot","This is my second coffee warmer. I lost my first one, a no-name cheap model that worked beautifully, so I bought two of the Mr. Coffee version, one for me and one for my spouse. It really won't maintain the temperature of the coffee until your cup is down to about 1 ounce left. I would not recommend this product. We had the same experience with both Mr. Coffee warmers, so it wasn't a case of a defective item. It just doesn't work."
1105,Positive,Very nice product,"I have been using this product for a few weeks. I have a ceramic tea pot that I use to make a few cups of tea at a time, and the tea was getting cold way too quickly. This product keeps my whole pot of tea nice and warm for as long as it takes me to drink -- which has been up to about six hours. I'm getting ready to buy a second one for my tea cup, so my tea stays warm once I pour it from the tea pot."
1106,Negative,Doesn't keep coffee warm,"Purchased this in 2010. Doesn't keep coffee warm. Well, barely warm -- but significantly cooler than I'd like. My preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured -- not crazy hot, but more than lukewarm. This isn't even close. And don't even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because you've been carrying it around for a few minutes."
1107,Negative,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,"The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer truely is a mug warmer. I use it daily. My mug is warm, but my beverage isn't."
1108,Positive,"Good heat, limited space",The warmer works just fine at keeping coffee warm. The switch on the body of the unit is easy to locate (as opposed to one on the cord). The one downside is that it is too small to hold a very large mug. I guess it just holds the standard size.
1109,Positive,Works pretty well for regular sized mugs,"The hot plate part is not big enough to fit the Starbucks ""city"" mugs, so note that. But a smaller mug (a.k.a. regular sized or one that doesn't have a wide base) will fit fine. I agree with other reviewers who said that it keeps drinks warm when full and hotter when less full. I think the product description should specify the size mug that fits. i will keep it because it works well."
1110,Positive,Works Well Keeping Coffee Warm,This works well to keep your coffee warm longer. It doesnot keep hot like when it comes out of the coffee makebut it does keep it warm long enough for you to finish yourcoffee.
1111,Positive,Awesome!!!!,"I'm a huge tea drinker & I enjoy drinking coffee. But with my work, I'm constantly running around the office so if it wasn't for this warmer, my coffee & tea would be ice cold, but this warmer really keeps it luke warm. But of course the first few times there was a smell when my metallic mug is placed on the warmer. But now the smell is gone."
1112,Negative,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer / Disappointed,It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
1113,Negative,Worthless Piece of Crap!,"This thing needs a High Med Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low. I made a cup of really nice organic Japanese Shade grown tea ($40 an ounce) and asked my wife to bring me an ice cube to warm it up after it had been on the heater for 10 minutes. The pad gets pretty hot, but not near hot enough to keep a cup of coffee hot. After something has been sitting on it for about 10 - 15 minutes you can gulp it with no fear of getting burnt. A Worthless piece of Crap. I will see if it works as a candle warmer."
1114,Negative,Not happy with this one!,I have not experienced an even warm cup of tea let alone hot since using this product. I tried pre-heating it and still no results. Very disappointed. I positively don't recommend this product.
1115,Negative,Doesn't keep coffee hot,Only keeps coffee tepid at best. Actual element gets very hot; it just doesn't reach the coffee. Item is small enough to stay on the table. It makes an expensive coaster.
1116,Negative,Disappointed,I am very disappointed in the Mr. coffee cup warmer. My coffee is really hot when I first put it on however on theMr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmerin less than an hour the coffee is luke warm. I can't stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion. Don't waste your money. Why can't they make a good coffee cup warmer? I am still looking
1117,Negative,disappointment,"I was a great fan of the Mr. Coffee MUG-ACTIVATED warmer. The ones I had finally gave out so I looked to buying more, and some for friends. I could find only the ""on/off switch"" warmer (although it was initially called ""mug-activated"" on the screen) so ordered 2. As already stated, the coffee is kept only warm, and you definitely have to remember to turn OFF the warmer or you could return hours later and find it still ON, which could be a danger. I have been unable to find a mug-activated warmer, but continue the search because I do not believe this ""on/off switch"" is any good."
1118,Negative,What a rip off!,Three criticisms:1. The narrator didn't explain the phenomenon of Waterpocket Fold.2. $3.00 for ten minutes!3. Cheesy coloration.
1119,Positive,westmoreland glassware review,"Great history of the company, but I was disappointed in the little milk glass content. The author talks about how important the opal (milk) glass line was for business, but does not offer much samples of it in the book."
1120,Negative,DISAPPOINTING,"This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points, but extremely weak on others. It provides the most detailed history of Westmoreland Glass that I have ever seen, and some of the facts are fascinating. However, it is very, very, very poorly organized. Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should. I would NOT recommend Kovar's books on any subject."
1121,Negative,Not what you think.........,"If you read above, it says that there are 4 discs on this record. Then you look at the top and see only two discs. I expected the entire 4 disc collection, but got only two. So if this being advertised above as two and it says 4 down below, shouldnt this be corrected or is this a case of false advertising???"
1122,Negative,truly boring,"This book was a waste of my time - I bought the bundle and now I'm not going to bother reading any more of Ms Cruise's ghastly stories. The dialogue was atrocious (and not at all amusing), not once did I even crack a smile, let alone laugh out loud, and the plot was so neatly wrapped up that it underscored its decided lack of depth.Agree with another reviewer - if you want mystery and romance, read Janet Evanovich!"
1123,Positive,Highly Recommended...,"This is an Awesome CD done by Derryl Perry, Higly Recommend it. Most of the song He wrote and some collaborated with other songwriters like him, Outstanding Vocals and Musician plus Songwriter!!!"
1124,Negative,Holes drilled incorrectly,Aside from missing a few bolts I also found that the holes in the seat are drilled incorrectly. I will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem. This is as far as I have gotten in the assembly as I have ran out of daylight. I am sure when it is finally together it will be a 3/5 bench as opposed to my current 2/5 rating. The shipping went well as It got here on time.
1125,Negative,Stats Class Workbook,"The workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course. VERY UNHAPPY. I wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software, but only to send it back. I need the workbook for my class, and the class is in its fourth week. I have since ordered the software from the manufacturer.Jim McShane"
1126,Negative,Too bad Galbraith isn't much of an economist.,"Galbraith is a very clear writer. He rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics. But unlike some other popular writers, it isn't because he is able to explain complex phenomena without them. He doesn't appear to understand them. This book reads like a fairy tale or child's letter to Santa Claus. Mr. Galbraith doesn't seem to understand economics well enough to pass economics 101. But he does have an excellent command of the English language."
1127,Negative,smallville season 9-amazon (beware of DVD wrong region number),Please beware that this DVD that I purchased for use in the UK is the wrong region number. It was sold to me who live currently in the UK but it only works in region 1 DVD players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it I need to change settings of my DVD player but it has to be watched at once because I won't be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that. The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100% in those cases. It was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the UK which was really not a good sign. All customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for.I am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
1128,Positive,justice league done right finally,smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
1129,Positive,Smallville Season 9 Rocks!!!,"There are some folks who dislike season 9, but that just because they still want to see Clark as that farm boy from Smallville. Yet, they don't realized that Clark is no longer the farm boy that we all love, but a news reporter who is embracing his destiny as the future superman. Yes, I still miss the Kent farm, The Talon, the Torch and even Smallville High School, but we must move on. In season 9, Clark is one step closer in being Superman, but he must first deal with his own personal issues, including his new love for Lois. I love seeing new heroes on the show, including Stargirl and Hawkman. Won't spoil more, but season 9 is far the best."
1130,Positive,smallville so far,i am a big fan of this show a big super man fan even more and everything theyve done couldnt have seen it done any other way im not a big comic book person mom never let me collect them but what i do know is the original movies are good but the stories were nowhere compared to this show the new movie i didnt like at all but i hear that lana has her own comic so i think it was important to keep her on the show for as long as they did im anxious to get the louis and clarke mess rolling cause u know theres going to be lots of laughs and i hope they keep this show going for along time even if they have a bad season or two bc 2 many shows r getting cancelled for the reason that people who rate good shows bad bring them down so i hope it keeps going like its going so we can keep enjoying this great show bc it hs great story lines good characters and so far a good record knock on wood
1131,Negative,smallville season 9,needs to be better packaged. it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through.
1132,Positive,mesmerizing marlene,"If anyone else but Marlene Dietrich had played the lead in this film, the film would have been awful! Dietrich triumphs in a role no-one would have predicted. mysterious, mesmerizing, seductive, funny, and finally moving as the loyal gypsy(!) Lyddia, Dietrich makes you overlook the films flaws. At times the film drags by, some supporting players seem to have cotton in their mouths as they speak, and some of the dialogue is inane. Through it all, Dietrich is the soul of this movie, holding it all together in spite of the flaws, to make the whole thing work. Worth watching as a romantic piece of Hollywood escapism, and for seeing Dietrich as the fine actress she is."
1133,Positive,Why in the world did they choose full screen ?,This is one of my favorite movies. I own the Lasedisc on widescreen. I could not wait for the DVD. I can't understand their decision to release this gem of a movie in the full screen version only. What a shame!
1134,Negative,Pan and Scan? No thanks!,"Rats. I was all ready to buy this movie, but the ephemistic ""Full-screen format"" (i.e. Pan and Scan) stopped me cold. The reason I bought a DVD player in the first place, besides the great running commentaries included with many movies, is so I could see the entire image the director intended, not some cropped 4:3 editted-for-television version.Call me a purist, but I just don't buy cropped DVDs like this one."
1135,Negative,Blu ray wouldn't play,"I have a toshiba Blu ray player that's a year old and this Blu ray DVD would not play in my player because it's so new and apparently a 1 year old Blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs $40. So now I'm reluctant to buy Blu rays. I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now. I gave this DVD to a friend and I'm sure it's fine, so just don't get it unless you have a new Blu ray player."
1136,Positive,Love this movie,"Great movie, lots of fun. I rent it every year so I bought it. It's a light movie with a great cast. It reminds me of home."
1137,Positive,Good DVD,"this DVD is a good show. it is good to see DVDs still widely availible. DVD is able to have true stereo, and, or sourround sound."
1138,Negative,Why Is This Not Letterboxed?,"I have rated the ""DVD"" the lowest possible rating, although I would give the movie the highest rating. Who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox? With the advent of DVD's, there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it's New York glory. I absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued, remastered and includes some serious extras. This is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time."
1139,Positive,"Fullness, Balance, and Challenge","As if attending a crusade event in person, the reader will find the always compassionate, passionate, and caring Billy Graham pleading for unbelievers to believe, believers to come to the fullness promised to them as children of God, and for those needing clarity on this important subject to hit THE BOOK and discover through the Holy Spirit what they need. As I read, I kept thinking, ""I miss Dr. Graham."" Then, I turned on the TV and one of his ""classic"" crusade presentations was on a religious channel. You sometimes forget what a great teacher, preacher, evangelist and pastor he was.GREAT, GREAT book that will bless, challenge, and inspire you to reach higher in your walk with the Lord."
1140,Negative,NOT for introductory food,"The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job."
1141,Positive,"Not my favorite diapers, but still great","I prefer Swaddlers to Baby Dry during the day, but they're hard to find in bigger sizes. These Baby Dry Pampers will hold a LOT. My son sleeps 10 to 12 hours a night (8 months old) and the diaper lasts all night without every leaking. These big packs from Amazon are fantastic, too. The price is less per diaper than from [...] and even Sam's Club plus Amazon does free Two-Day Shipping on diapers right now. (I won a free year of Amazon Prime for one of my diaper orders, too!) Can't beat that."
1142,Positive,auto delivery,"I created an account to have diapers delivered to my daughter's house. Having twins, her life is busy enough. Free shipping, can't beat it. love this idea."
1143,Negative,Does not keep your baby dry,"So I bought these diapers because I have used the Swaddlers before with success. My daughter is 9 weeks old, 10 pounds and uses size 1. For anyone that has not used Swaddlers, the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner, almost paper thin. Upon the first use of this diaper, I noticed that after a 2 hour nap, my daughter's onesie was was wet. I gave the diaper another chance, and had exactly the same issue. I would not recommend this diaper as I believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry."
1144,Positive,good diaper,"These are good diapers that don't leak, even with overnight soakings. They don't hold up to blowouts as well as huggies little movers, however."
1145,Positive,Great diapers,"Pampers and Huggies are, in our opinion, the best diaper brands out there. We have a slightly preference for Pampers because they look less ""bulky"" on the baby, compared to Huggies or store brands. And it is the best deal I have for diapers, considering the 15% discount from Amazon ""Subscribe & Save"" program. However, I've noticed that the diaper is no longer available as a ""Subscribe & Save"" item, so I am not sure whether I would buy it for the full price - I would have to compared unit costs using my spreadsheet to see if it is worth it."
1146,Negative,THEY LEAK - Use SWADDLERS!!!,Pampers Baby Dry is a huge misnomer...they are terrible for urine intake! If your baby sleeps on their tummy through the night...YOU WILL WAKE UP WITH A WET BABY AND WET SHEETS/EVERYTHING!Use Pampers Swaddlers...at least until after size 3 as that is the largest size Swaddlers they make for some reason. You can thank me later. BABY DRY = WET BABY~~!!!
1147,Negative,Leaks at the kid's belly,"Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing."
1148,Positive,best diapers ever!,Well!We never had any issues with pampers brand of diapers.We've tried all other brands (Cheaper & expensive ones) and nothing comes close to diapers.
1149,Positive,Best Diapers Ever,From testing all kind of brands from every store possible Pampers Baby Dry is far most the best out there!
1150,Positive,i loved this item,"i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country , so i had to cancel. My baby never had problem with these diapers.thanks."
1151,Positive,Best for the price,"Not as soft as Pampers Swaddler, but I prefer them to the regular Huggies and like them equally as the Huggies Little Snugglers which are much more expensive. Very absorbent, never got a leak with them and my baby sleeps for 12 hours at night."
1152,Positive,"Good price, no wetness strip","Don't get confused here, this isn't a swaddler style diaper. There is NO, I repeat... NO wetness strip. This diaper came up when we searched for swaddler and its our mistake for not reading closer. The diaper is a bit small in size compared to the swaddler ones and the lack of wetness strip makes it an easy 2nd place choice to the same size Pamper Swaddler."
1153,Negative,Weren't So Great.,"We didn't like these AT ALL. I am a big fan of swaddlers, and these are nothing like the soft, meshy swaddlers. These are crunchy and thin like store-brand diapers. With swaddlers I could easily let my 3 month old go overnight without a diaper change, but these leaked all over the front of me when I picked him up in the morning. Hated them."
1154,Negative,New and Improved with Sagging Technology,"It takes a lot for me to dislike a product, but these are terrible! After a half hour the diaper would sag and look like it was extremely wet, when in reality there was hardly anything in it. They don't seem to hold much before leaking, even doubling the diapers for overnight still doesn't prevent leakage. Definitely, not something I will ever purchase again no matter how good the price is."
1155,Negative,Stick with the Pampers Swaddlers!,"My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But, even though they are less expensive, the Baby Dry type are not worth it! I found them cheap looking and feeling (they could have been mistaken for a store brand.) The absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad, my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet (there was not a fit issue, he was the correct weight for the size I bought, and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper, but literally from the seat.) From now on, I will definitely stick with the Pampers Swaddlers type."
1156,Negative,Horrible Diapers,"I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also, they do not absorb at all...not worth the savings!"
1157,Positive,Best for the Price,"There are less expensive diapers out there, but I found that Pampers and Huggies might be more money, but are the better diaper too. I also found that Baby Dry diapers were the least expensive of the diapers that work. I have a girl and they work great. I really don't even price check anymore. I just get these using amazon mom and subscribe and save and get them as cheap as I can. I lot easier shopping for diapers when you have your favorite, and these are definitely my favorite.Edit October 2012: I now have another baby girl. I decided to give luvs a try again, and like them this time around. I didn't like them with my first daughter. Not sure if my opinion changed or if luvs changed their diaper up. There is definitely a different feel than other brands, but after amazon mom ended I started shopping again and now I get luvs from sam's club."
1158,Negative,no,We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
1159,Negative,Baby Dry but Covered with Poop,"After hitting the end of the line with Pampers Swaddlers, which max out in a size 2-3, we figured ""Baby Dry"" was the logical next step. *Every* time our daughter pooped it came right up the back and on to her outfit, her mother, the sofa--you name it. She is right in the size range. We will *not* be buying this diaper again."
1160,Negative,Quality dropped in the last 6 months,"I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency, the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option. The strip is not as wide to catch urine, it's been cut down. Constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet, the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything. We've had to change out the sheets, clothes and anything else everyday. Several times, the diapers have ripped apart so bad, they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out. I've grown more concerned, that since it's coming out so bad, it's coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it. Is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost 3 times more expensive overnights? I don't know, but they certainly aren't what they have been for the last 8 years."
1161,Negative,Worst Ever!!,these daipers are no good to use.. always leaks and gives diaper rash.. not worth the money.. Pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.
1162,Negative,There is a reason for cheaper price,"Baby dry was okay until my daughter's poop got bigger! It leaks! We even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday. I was very frustrated. Then I changed to Pampers Cruisers with Dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one. It worked perfectly!! No leaking and no washing of clothes any more!! But if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter, baby dry was okay. You just have to change often though."
1163,Positive,The softest diapers out there with the best fit ever!,These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size. I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.
1164,Positive,the best but only this time,pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs. however their collect points promotion is misleading. by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection. also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store. dishonest and mean spirited. next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.
1165,Positive,"Swaddlers are better, but...","I wish Swaddlers went up to my son's size. He is 4 months old and already weighs 24 lbs. These are good, but Swaddlers in bigger sizes would be ideal. I have not yet tried the cruisers, but based on ratings, these seem to be what most prefer. I have not had any problems with these, excet my son outgrows them so fast! Each shipment I order, it seems I have to go up a size. Love Pampers products."
1166,Positive,Keeps baby dry and no diaper rash!,"I've tried many diapers over the years and I've found that Pampers are the best. They fit well, provide the right amount of ventilation so our babies don't get a rash and they hold a lot of liquid. My only complaint is the price. They are so darn expensive!"
1167,Negative,Not as good as Huggies Snug & Dry,"When my son wheres Pampers, the poop always rides up his back. I am very disappointed in these diapers and can't believe all the positive reviews. I gave it 2 stars because it does hold in pee alright for 3-4 hours max. These diapers don't perform as well as Huggies Snug & Dry."
1168,Positive,Best fit for my baby,"This product is wonderful !! and the best fit for our baby. We tried Swaddlers because of a friend's recommendation, but our 6 month old got rashes within the first week of using it. We switched back to Baby Dry and the rash was gone within 3 days !! Definitely recommended by me."
1169,Negative,Fall Apart,"I love Pampers Swaddlers so I thought I'd try these once my baby outgrew the Swaddlers. While I've never had any issues with leaking, I've had to throw out at least four brand-new diapers (so far) because the the entire side where the tab tears off while I'm trying to fasten the diaper. I've never had this problem with Swaddlers or Huggies, so I know it's not the operator. Also, these diapers don't seem to fit very securely. They tend to sag and feel very cheap (even my husband commented on that and he generally doesn't notice these kinds of things). I've only used about 20 diapers from my box of 140, but I'm sure I'll have more problems with tearing. What a waste!"
1170,Negative,Leaky and expensive,These diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers. Usually i don't buy them because of high cost but I bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite. They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps. I usually use LUVS DIAPERS. They are far betther than these and cheaper as well. I made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be good.People don't waste your money in this junk product.
1171,Positive,best for the $$$,"these do a very, very good job. huggies supreme hold a bit more liquid but for the price the best you can get. actually like better than the pampers cruisers and they cost less. with the amount in the box - one case is good for almost a month. rarely leak - even w/ a 2 year old at night."
1172,Negative,Incomplete Shipment,The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
1173,Negative,Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY,"We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand, the ""swaddlers"" take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes. We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers."
1174,Positive,Great diapers!,"We have tried several brands of diapers and definitely prefer Pampers for our son. They fit him best and we very rarely have ""explosions."" This box is a great value."
1175,Negative,horrible diapers ever,Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 246 CountI'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BUYING THESE DIAPERS. I thought it is a good deal and i can save some money. but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back. since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoud've been this way so i put one on my 1 month and half baby girl. when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked. her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far. i put several pastes and cream to treat it. it took almost 2 day to get rid of them finally. she had been using this particular diaper like for 2 hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction. i dont understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined. do not repeat my mistake. NEVER BUY these diapers !!!
1176,Positive,Maybe this will help...,"A lot of people are writing about the size not being accurate -- the size of the 1-2s are the same as the 1s, but I noticed that the 1-2s have a blue liner. I am wondering if they're intended for babies who need the size of the 1s with the absorbancy of the 2s? Does anyone else know? Pampers doesn't have anything on their website..."
1177,Positive,These are great diapers!,"I have been using Pampers Baby-Dry diapers since Zach was only a few weeks old. These are the only diapers I will use on him. They are soft and comfortable for him. I can't say there was never an incident of a leaky diaper, but I would love to meet the mom who has never had a diaper mess at one point or other! LOL I have tried other diapers, but these seem to be the most comfy and best control against diaper accidents."
1178,Negative,No Good,"The diaper is too thin that it hardly holds anything. We found we literally had to change the diaper for our kid every hour. Interestingly, the same Pamper diaper we bought from local supermarket or Walmart store was a lot better and could last for several hours."
1179,Negative,Baby Dry = Leaks!,"We tried Pampers Baby Dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day! Our one year old baby is a size 3 and doesn't have any problems in swaddlers, cruisers or other store brand diapers. I couldn't believe how leaky these were!"
1180,Negative,Pampers Baby Dry - not recommended,"I purchased these baby dry thinking we could step up from the Pampers Swaddlers. I was wrong. I just assumed they would be as good as the swaddlers but they are not. My baby girl is 6 months and is an average baby...not chunky or big (other reviews mentioned it may have an impact on the diaper)Here are my con's:-do not absorb like I need them to. She is up one to two times per night and if I don't change her at one of the feedings by morning she will be in a puddle and I will have to wash everything.-they are not nearly as soft as swaddlers.- when she is really wet the inside of the diaper will come apart and stick to her..it is a stringy something that sticks to her legs.yuck.They really are fine during the day, it is at nap and night time that she seems to over flow out of the diaper. I will not order another box of these. I was honestly shocked that they were not better because I really love pampers. Oh well. live and learn."
1181,Positive,Gr8 Product,"My kid is enjoying , Daiper takes lot more time than other ones and still will be fresh and dry"
1182,Negative,Not dependable,"We found this diaper undependable. Leaky and can't take an average load (liquid or solid). Difficult to manage the night shift, when his clothes and the sheets get wet.Prefer swaddlers any day."
1183,Positive,Best value,"I already have good luck with Pampers So far, no complaints. People who are disappointed that there is no blue line, I thought it would make them like those I used to. Then I figured out the blue line only instead of Pampers Swaddlers Pampers diapers in the dry. I have started to buy diapers through Amazon only, because if you use Amazon subscribe and save discount they are cheaper than you can get even at a substantial discount in membership stores."
1184,Positive,Best Diapers,"My little man sleeps 12-14 hours a night, and these are the BEST diapers for leak protection!! If you do the Amazon Mom subscribe & save, it's an even better deal than cheapo diapers! With subscribe and save, I get a box of these each month, delivered to my door. So fantastic & worry free. HIGHLY recommend."
1185,Negative,Good,I like the price and quantity in the package but I'm noticing now that they are holding up overnight. I've recently changed to a more absorbent diaper at night.
1186,Positive,"Good Diapers, Subscribe and Save rules!","Probably my 2nd favorite disposable I find them to be very reliable and they smell nice. However the scent does concern me and while all disposables contain chemicals I wonder about the more so when I'm using scented Pampers. Regardless, combined with Subscribe and Save this is a total win-win the price and service can't be beat. I'm a ""part-time"" cloth diaper user and subscribe and save has made filling in the gaps very easy I can't say enough how much I love it."
1187,Negative,Not as good as Cruisers,"I normally buy Pampers Cruisers, I will not buy these again. They seem really cheap, plastic like, I don't like the smell. Yuck, can't wait for the jumbo pack to be done!"
1188,Positive,Pampers Size 4 Economy Pack,I ordered the Economy Pack of Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 and I LOVE Pampers although the size is a little small for 4 it was very convenient and nice sized!! I will order this product again!!!
1189,Positive,Best diapers for us,"I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save."
1190,Positive,Best Diapers at a great price,"I've looked at quite a few different places to get a good price on diapers, and Amazon has been the best (same price as my local stores, but they get delivered right to my door, free shipping) I calcuate the price per diaper, and Amazon is always the cheaper, or equal to other sites/local stores.As for the diaper itself, I love pampers brand (for diapers, not wipes) over any other diaper brand. I prefer the ""baby dry"" over the cruisers (for price and quality) and now that they make the baby dry with the ""caterpillar stretch"" sides, they're even better! They fit like a dream, even on my skinny little boy!!! My 18 month old son has been in pampers since the day he was born, and any leaks are VERY VERY rare, even overnight when he's sleeping 11+ hours.I am very price-aware, and Amazon and Pampers fit my budget perfectly!"
1191,Negative,Gave a rash,"I bought the XL case of Pampers Baby dry in size 3 and after only 5 diapers my son has a horrible rash on his entire back where the diaper touches.My son's skin is not sensitive and we have used Pampers swaddlers, Hugggies Snugglers,Huggies Snug n Dry, Parents Choice and Comforts (kroger) brand and he has never had any issue.now I am stuck with this XL case of diapers."
1192,Negative,Not my favorite,We used Pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size 3 they did not work. The swaddlers didn't have good protection and he would poop out of them. We decided to try baby dry. They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of. Now I am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least 3 outfits a day. I am really not happy with Baby Dry. I loved Pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of Pampers and had to switch to huggies. :(
1193,Negative,Terrible Smell and Horrible Rash,"We've been getting Pampers Baby Dry from a Wholesale club for a while now, with no problems (my son is 13 months, in size 4). I saw the price on Amazon and with the 30% off, it was a great deal. However, when the box arrived the diapers smelled AWFUL -- chemical-like. I gave them a day to air out, which they did, but in the next few days of using them my son has developed a terrible diaper rash. He has only had tiny rashes 3-4 times in the past, but this one is continuous and awful-looking. We are discontinuing use of these particular ones immediately, and going back to the Wholesale club. I don't think it's Baby Dry, per se, but the shipment that Amazon has. It really upsets me that they would offer inferior diapers at such a reduced price -- they need to be tossed and NEVER touch a baby's skin."
1194,Positive,Great deal..,when you subscribe! I recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price! I recommend if you've got little Pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product :) I saved a bit even with my first shipment! HAPPY mommy!
1195,Positive,Gr8 product & Gr8 deal from Amazon,Wonderful product at a great deal from Amazon.Babies will luv them.ALL stars. I am in for repeat orders for the Pampers diapers.
1196,Positive,awesome! I save a lot of money,It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
1197,Positive,Good diaper,"This is the best diaper I have found next to the old Pampers Cruisers. They are not as soft as I'd like and they don't have a liner like I'd want, but they don't leak even after a 12 hour night with my heavy wetter. They are more economical than the new Pampers Cruisers and I think probably a better diaper overall anyway."
1198,Negative,Pampers,"These pampers were the worst, my son was soaked. Every nightI Switched to o overnight ones which are great, no leaks"
1199,Positive,great,Loved this product for my baby. I have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night.
1200,Negative,Not absorbant enough,I liked these the best when my baby was 16 lbs. but now at 20lbs he leaks through every one of them in 2 hours or less. The 4's fit a little too big and I know he's almost ready but these are supposed to be good to 28lbs and they are not. I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don't trust them. Size 3 of Sam's Club brand is working WAY better than these and cost less too.
1201,Negative,Leak with breastfeed poop up the back!,These diapers leek up the back when my baby poops! Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on! Annoying!!
1202,Positive,Great for the price!,I love these diapers. i have been using it for my son during the day. with the discounts and and all others amazon coupons i got this for a very decent price. i think 50% discount is very good. its been almost a month and i still have half of the box to be used.
1203,Negative,Not what the name implies!,"My daughter was wearing the Huggies prior to this. I ordered this diapers, thinking that they would be softer and more absorbent than the Huggies. To my surprise, they are neither softer or more absorbent. I'm very disappointed and have had to change many skirts, and pants because of this!I am planning on writing to Kimberly Clark as well regarding this. Also, these diapers run small!"
1204,Negative,Not good for night times,"Target diapers are much better than these diapers. My daughter sleeps through the night. When she wakes up her dress, the sheet everything will be wet. This diaper is ok to use during the day times but definitely not at night."
1205,Negative,hyped!,"Walt Whitman's literary reputation has been hyped by ""gay"" critics (I suspect). I'm not totally hostile to free verse; in fact, I like T.S. Eliot, the most famous proponent of this genre, but Whitman wrote ramblingly, seemingly devoid of poetic coherence that the reader's creative imagination is left unstirred. I agree with Robert Frost, the truly great American poet, that writing poetry without the classic, conventional rules is like playing tennis--with no net."
1206,Positive,Book Review,"This book of poetry covers some very heavy stuff. At the same time, the subject matters cover a lot of matters that I've wanted to read for a while.I suggest that you do not read his poetry silently. Say it all out loud! They're meant to be read loud and proud. Trust me, that's worth it."
1207,Negative,Rip Off,"This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents, which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall.Save your dollar and look elsewhere."
1208,Negative,A Mistake,"A co-worker gave this book to me. He was more of a fan than I, but Whitman grew on me, and over the next several months, I learned to appreciate his work.However, I left this book above my toilet and was disturbed that a relative of mine snooped through it while taking a dump, discovering secrets that this co-worker and I had together. I now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it."
1209,Negative,Shameful,"In my opinion, this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage. My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating. To make matters worse, there doesn't seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events, even if one is willing to pay for it. Nor does the Olympic website itself have videos of the events. I could understand if we were searching the week of the Olympics, or even that month. However, it's been close to a year. SHAME ON YOU NBC. The Olympics are not yours."
1210,Negative,Did I watch the same movie???,"Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused. Was it the same movie? The martial arts were ""ok"" in this, but nothing I havent seen done better before. The story-line was.. ummm. well, nevermind.Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end???? I mean I didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious!"
1211,Negative,.... HYBRID CD is a joke !!,...The surround sound on this disc in non-existent. There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer. If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ... This label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music. ...
1212,Positive,Power Off Solution?,"I've had my 940MW for over a year. When 1st received, after turning on, it would work for 5 to 10 minutes and then cut off. I tried removing and re-pluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off. Then I tried a different approach. I removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars. SINCE THEN, THE MONITOR HAS NOT 'TURNED ITSELF OFF' ONCE!I believe that what was happening, in my case anyway, was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of AC. Squeezing the power cord with the pliars 'tightened up' the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact. I looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord, and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that I think they should be. I think that that caused the problem.Don't know if this helps anyone else.That is the only reason I don't give this monitor a 5 rating."
1213,Negative,bad power suplly,i bought this 18 months ago. i purchased a refurb unitwell about 2 months ago the ps started to act up.$90.00 later it's working again. Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
1214,Negative,Does not adhere (peels off),"So I tried this on a few things- attaching a leather strap to a suede bag I made, repairing leather sandal straps and trying to repair a shoe sole. The leather strap pulled off, the sandal repair came apart on vacation and the shoe sole didn't adhere properly, so it started to come off. When I pulled on the side that was coming off it pulled off in one big chunk. It seems like the glue sticks very well to itself, but not to the other materials you are trying to attach. And yes, I followed all of the instructions to a T. Still looking for a better shoe/leather glue."
1215,Positive,It Sticks!,The glue was easy to apply. My boyfriend attached it to his boots which were coming apart in some places ... Unfortunately the spot needing to be fixed wasn't one that could be fixed and the fix did not stay
1216,Positive,Love this stuff,Works great for repairing soles that start to come apart. It is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs. Highly Recommend
1217,Positive,Shoe Goo,"Shoe Goo works great. The bottom of my tennis shoe was peeling. I applied some shoe goo and glued the sole back on and let it dry 24 hours. Next day the tennis shoe was good. Shoe Goo really works! For the size, I should buy a smaller Shoe Goo."
1218,Positive,Beginning with Audrey growing up during WWII brought integrity.,I learned a lot about Audrey Hepburn's childhood that I had never realized before. Beginning in WWII brought the story home and made it real.
1219,Positive,What kind of person could have done this...,"Great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind. John Douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method: look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it. This is in contrast to the approach of: identify a likely suspect, then identify facts of the crime that fit the suspect. The author does not claim to solve all of the cases he studies in this book, but rather point us in the right direction. For example, he describes the likely personality characteristics and behavior of Jack the Ripper (interestingly this does not seem to match Patricia Cornwell's conclusion) and the Zodiac. His discussion of the Ramsey case is probably the most controversial since he was personally involved in the case. A well written and interesting book."
1220,Negative,"General Overview of Bizarre Cases, too obtuse for crime scholars.","A Dummy's Guide to Understanding Bizarre Murder Cases.-I would read this if you were a new immigrant to the Western world. So, i would look around for weightier books ,on a specific crime topic.This book is too broad and not informative enough .The reason why these cases haunt the FBI is that they need to turn on the light-switch."
1221,Positive,Fascinating Read,"I don't typically read this kind of work, but picking it up at a real bargain price, it looked interesting, given all the media attention this renown profiler receives.His analysis of this collection of unsolved mystery murders showcases his analytical abilities, honed over years of work. He primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas: context of area in which crime committed and victomology.From Jack the Ripper to JonBenet Ramsey, he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to him.One that fascinated me the most was the one I knew the least, the Lindbergh kidnapping. The missing chisel, the removed flooring, all this pointing to the convicted one. Also, that Gen. Schwartzkopf's relative was involved.These cases do hold our yearning to solve mystery, especially that where justice is sought and all can see if their hunches play out."
1222,Positive,Why doesn't Clay get played anymore!!!,Had this CD years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music. The CCM being played today can't hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering. Clay Crosse is amazing.
1223,Positive,My wife loves it,"The stones are a bit small, and not as colorful as the picture, but the necklace is beautiful and well made. Interesting clasp with a non-rolling chain. Nice."
1224,Negative,POOR QUALITY,"This is a very poor quality necklace. I needed to take it in direct light before I could see any stones, nothing like picture shown. No bill in the box, so sadly, I am unable to return."
1225,Negative,Really BAD,The product was in a very old box and the AC/DC connection was just a bare wire. So I did return this item.
1226,Negative,SKIPPING CD'S,MY CD OF CASSIE'S ME AND YOU SKIPS THROUGHOUT THE CD. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A CD FROM AMAZON THAT HAS SKIPPED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I ORDER ANY CD'S FROM AMAZON. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I'VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!
1227,Positive,"If you're a ""difficult"" size/in a time crunch","I had to quickly find a dress to go to a wedding, and I was distressed by how little I could find in my size readily available on the web or in stores. Amazon was the last place I looked and this is the first thing that popped up, and it's perfect. It fits, it's appropriate, and it's cheap and fast. If you're plus size and tearing your hair out over how slim the pickings are [especially if you have an ounce of taste and don't like the traditional plus size color palette/prints], this is your solution. Also, the only alternatives I found were all ""special order at least two months ahead"" gowns. Hello, who does anything two months ahead any more? If time is not a luxury you can afford, this is your solution as well."
1228,Positive,"In the rain or in the snow, got the got the funky flow.","This is the soundtrack to the classic Playstationgame. If features all the songs from the game, plus all the instrumental music cues. The songs, most of which are rap songs, are really cute and amusing. The instrumentals are similarly ""cutesy"", and almost all of them are under a minute long (a few are less than ten seconds long). If you are a fan of this game, I'm sure you will enjoy the soundtrack."
1229,Positive,easy to understand guide,"When my 6 year old niece was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, my family was devastated. Her parents are both RNs, and so could more easily understand a lot of the terminology and treatments. I have absolutely no medical background, and I found this book to be very helpful. This book provided comprehensive explanations of various treatments, commonly used drugs, different types of brain and spinal cord tumors, etc. that were easy for a layperson to understand. I also really liked that there were many shared experiences from other families who had dealt with childhood cancer, it made me feel like we weren't alone. There are new treatments that come out all the time, so obviously some of the information may be dated, but overall I thought this was an excellent guide for anyone caring for a child with brain cancer."
1230,Negative,Not pleased,"I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons. First off this product did not teach me much of the Italian language, which is its whole purpose. Secondly, I felt very lost from one part to another it just seemed very unclear as to what I was always supposed to be doing. My advice is to consider a competitor's product before this one. A good alternative product to look at would be Italian Now by Transparent Language, which is very well done."
1231,Positive,BibleMan a great Video,"Absolutely wonderful video, my preschoolers love it and now go around playing Bibleman the hero, They shout out ""Word Power"" to fight bad guy. This is a great improvement from playing slash and shoot them-up. The price was great."
1232,Negative,There's a reason this was only on TV,"The original Patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies. George C. Scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors. I was happy to find this movie on Amazon on Demand, but was disappointed with the movie itself.-Looks like a low-budget made for TV movie which it is.-Casting was poor. Outside of George C. Scott these were a bunch of B or C actors. Richard Dysart as Eisenhower was particularly bad.-As noted in many other reviews, the video quality was poor.-Way too long and way too depressing.I was hoping this movie would cover more of the postwar Patton and less of George C. Scott lying in a hospital bed. If they cut off the last third of the movie, it might be four stars.I recommend you pass on this movie, at the very least stop watching after the accident. He suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies. There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LOT of overacting."
1233,Positive,excellent healthy eating book,"Love the book, has many recipes in it. I have used many of them and they not only taste good but do help u feel better"
1234,Positive,11 x 14 Windsor Newton canvas pack,The item came in record time and in perfect condition. This was the second time that I have ordered this item and I will reorder it again in the future possibly in a different size.
1235,Negative,Received just one canvas,The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons.
1236,Positive,Philip K. Dick would be proud!,"This film is actually four short films... One film (The Robot Fixer) actually has little to do with technology or ""robotics"" as we usually perceive it (Lets play, ""One of these films is not like the others""), while the others are very good speculative fiction pieces which make you go hmmm. I thought that Pak made the most use of his time and pulled the viewer into each story universe quite thoroughly.After a week of working 16 hour days in the astrodome after the Hurricane Katrina survivors came in, it was the perfect way to spend my first evening back with the family! I highly recommend."
1237,Negative,Defective Machine - Don't buy!,"I was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe. At first, the cofee was great. Then a couple of weeks later, coffee started to pour directly out of the machine onto the floor! I thought maybe I had a bad machine, so I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one. A month later, same problem! The coffee pours around the caraffe, not into it. I burned myself trying to clean it up, and it stained my nice kitchen floors. I'm taking it back for a different brand coffee maker, I won't be fooled three times!"
1238,Positive,Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles,"I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well, bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case.I can't be critical of much in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now, again, on dvd. It's well acted, well scripted, and well produced. I think Ian Richardson is my favourite Sherlock Holmes - although I don't think he played the role as many times as other actors. Again, he brings such confidence in his ability, that as a viewer you don't really think he's not going to solve the mystery.Thumbs up. Enjoy."
1239,Positive,Supreme Coltrane,"A wonderful and creative album. Great listening from start to finish. Belongs in every jazz library along with Blue Train, Giant Steps, and Kind Of Blue."
1240,Positive,wow!,I'm new to Jazz and I find that I love this stuff. I guess it's bop. This is a must have album for anyone. I highly recommend. I got it on vinyl which is still one of the best ways to hear music. Love it!
1241,Positive,Five stars?,"There are not enough stars in the sky, and no words I can say here that will do it justice."
1242,Positive,Spirituality in sound supreme,"A LOVE SUPREME was for John Coltrane, both an intensely personal statement, and a gift to mankind. On the brink of ruination due to alcohol and drug abuse, Coltrane had a life altering epiphany in 1957. On the liner notes to the album he writes:""During the year 1957, I experienced by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.""A LOVE SUPREME was recorded in 1964 after the death of his friend, Eric Dolphy, and the birth of his 1st son. These events must have inspired Coltrane to create his masterpiece. Outside of Bach's B Minor Mass, I can't think of a greater work of pure spirituality in music. Whether or not you are into Jazz, you should listen to A LOVE SUPREME at least once in your life."
1243,Positive,Silicone Case for Palm Treo 755p,I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.
1244,Negative,Phone Cover,"Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain."
1245,Positive,Luck of the Irish,I bought this CD as a Christmas present for my wife who is Irish...she loves it....so do I and I'm not Irish.
1246,Positive,Crazy and totally wonderful,A thoroughly wonderful movie that had me laughing in no time. Melanie Griffith is outstanding in this zany story. Highly recommend
1247,Negative,Disappointed,"I own another Sony VCR (SLV N-71) which is nice. This one was for the kids, but it's going back. The VCR is noisy - very distracting. Picture is fair. I expect more from Sony products."
1248,Positive,Great 80's Concept Album !,"It's moody, a little dark, like for driving down the highway at night . . . But that's why I loved it in the 1980's ! I just was never able to find the CD ! To me, it is the most well-done, well-produced album by Tommy Shaw, as I have heard most of his others to date . . . Still, yes, it has a certain heavy keyboard-80's sound, but it is more 'serious' than his other efforts in my humble opinion . . .So, dark, but GREAT guitar, it should have really been the concept for another Styx album, instead of the more light-wieght stuff they all have done . . ."
1249,Negative,Complete Failure,"This Album Offers Absolutely Nothing Worth Wasting Time With. Shaw Had One Minor #33 Hit With ""Girls With Guns"", But Nothing On This One. People Forget That Shaw Only Contributed One Top 40 Hit (Too Much Time...) On His Final Three Albums With Styx, Before They Broke Up. Without Nugent And Blades His Career May Have Ended Here."
1250,Positive,anything KMFDM,Better than 2002 tour - BUT GUYS NEED AN UP TO DATE WITH CURRENT VERSIONS OF YOUR MUSIC - like a 2012 dvd.....PLEASE! Love them!!
1251,Negative,Don't buy this book!,"Only buy this book if you want to feel your child is a loser, it's ALL your fault and there's nothing you can do about it, EVER! I'm not even going to pass this book on, it's going in the trash! That being said, there are some great kids social skills books out there: 1.) The unwritten rules of friendship 2.) Nobody likes me, everybody s me 3.) Good friends are hard to find"
1252,Negative,Valeo WW2 2-lb wrist weights,"I used the weights once. Well, they almost made it..one of the wrist weights came apart at the seam and sand leaked all over the carpet."
1253,Negative,Valeo wrist weights,The wrist weight are one size that may be used by a very tiny and thin adult of 100 lbs or a child. I could not get them over my hand to my wrist. The advertising should say what size the hand needs to be and to use them.
1254,Positive,lite up,"The bulb seems ok, the batteries have power, but the laser light does not work.The bulb came in 4days."
1255,Negative,I haven't received my items,It has been a month after the estimated date my items would have reached me and they haven't. Can you check on this???
1256,Positive,Have fun with your baby!,"I love this DVD! Get ready to have fun and interact with your baby. This DVD gives you so many ideas to have fun and interact with you baby by just using items you already have around your house. I loved the bright colors, the music, Eeebee and the Mom. I highly recommend this DVD to all parents."
1257,Negative,Dissapointed,"I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD. I bought it based on a review in Parents magazine, and also from the reviews posted here. I feel Eebee DVD's are geared to children age 3-15 months when babies are just starting to move around. Little Eebee could not hold my toddler's attention. It was a waste of money for my 2 year old"
1258,Negative,Buy a different guidebook,This guidebook is a waste of money - info is too scattered and does not address areas I will be visiting
1259,Negative,Very disappointing,I liked the characters. He did a great job of letting the reader get to know the characters. However the plot was awful. At the end I was left feeling like he just threw a bunch of words together just to end the book. It's almost as though you're left wondering exactly what happened at the end.
1260,Negative,Another spin on socializing costs/risks and privatizing profits,What else to expect from a Cato Institute publication? They support the corporatism of space as the last frontier.
1261,Positive,brill,"this album is a must have. look for the similarities between sunny day and jane's addiction in 100 million - i swear it's there. every track is incredible - be warned that listening to it in already-sad states will lead to probably more sadness, but it's good to be there sometimes."
1262,Negative,"I Hate to Disagree, But...","Well, I have to say that I didn't really want to write a negative Sunny Day review, but then I thought of the unfortunate lads who would waste their money on this CD instead of buying a different Sunny Day CD. I am a big fan (driving 6 hours to see them play in a couple weeks) but I was kinda let down by this one. Diary and Self-Titled are strongly recommended."
1263,Negative,A great disappointment,"A am a huge SDRE fan, but to tell you the truth their new CD wasn't all that good, their old stuff was way better. SDRE has lost their style and emotion. This CD isn't worth buying."
1264,Negative,Chekov's Play is like a Half-Eaten Apple...,"Although Chekov's play accurately reflects the decline of Aristocratic power in 19th century Russia, it is unfulfilling. Mdm. Ranevskaya's Orchard is bought under her feet by a ""friend"" whose hunger for profit motivated his friendship with her. So this is the transformative moment: Mdm. Ranevskaya loses her most cherished possession, and then what? Her friend, Lopahin, feins innocense, Mdm. Ranevskaya runs off to Paris to whom or what? We never find out. It's sort of like biting into a pretty good apple only to have it fall on the ground."
1265,Negative,Author needs to take grade school writing lessons,"I didn't say anything then because that has a very good chance of happening, and there isn't really any way out once Uncle Frank gets you, except holding your breath for a really, really long time, which might spoil the day for everyone else, even though the ambulance would come and I would get to ride inside it while they saved my life.Verbatim quote of the author's writing abilities. I myself had a hard time trying to understand some of these sentences - imagine my first grader's annoyance.Run-on sentences, mixed verb tense, missing punctuation, you name it. The book should be called ""Bad writing lessons."" The editor must have been out sick the day this manuscript was turned in.Give it to a kid you dislike to repulse them away from reading.But the illustrations are nice. So, one star for that."
1266,Positive,Jane is a girl with spunk!,"My daughter Sadie and I love this book. The author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl. This girl, Jane, is smart and funny and spunky. It's a great story!"
1267,Positive,"One of the most disturbing ""war movies"" ever made.",Unfairly ignored during it's initial release this movie deserves another chance.Unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her.Michael J. Fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing.Fox proves he's got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part(even better than Bright Lights Big City)and Sean Penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far.I saw this in theaters in 1989 and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasn't lost it's impact.Director Brian DePalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter.The haunting score by Ennio Morricone that accompanies the poor girl's ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time.Tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you're looking for powerful cinema.
1268,Positive,Twentieth Century Pleasures: Prose on Poetry,Thank you for a textbook that was clean and in excellent condition!
1269,Negative,"Swimming against the tide, but...","An improvisation is wonderful, if, and this is a huge if, an improvement on the original is made. After listening to all 15 cuts I have to say that in every case the original is more enjoyable and satisfying to me to listen to. Can you really expect Montero to improve on Vivaldi? That really is too much. However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vivaldi, why would I spend money to listen to Montero? This revue is in no way a reflection on her pianistic abilities, but it sure is a gripe about butchering classic source material.My advice, and it seems to be unique among reviewers so far, is that if you like Vivaldi, listen to Vivaldi, not Montero seeking to change Vivaldi. Or Bach. Or Scarlatti. Or Pachebel...The original is stunning...the alterations to it are just misc. music."
1270,Negative,Ho-hum,"Not much new here. I listened to it for the Sarah song, and it is what gave it two stars. Not horrible, but the music is generic movie soundtrack music. The two versions of ""You Got A Friend In Me"" add nothing to the song. ""When She Loved Me"" is a nice song performed wonderfully by Sarah Mclachlan, but not enought to spend money on this whole CD."
1271,Positive,Amazing soundtrack,"This soundtrack is truly a piece of art. Randy Newman has done some great things with this album. ""When She Loved Me"" is a beautiful song that I can't help but listen to over and over again. The instrumental part (which makes up the majority of the album) is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable. If you've seen the movie, and paid any attention to the music at all, the soundtrack is a must. I put it in my CD player, sit back, and relax. I'll listen to this one for years to come."
1272,Negative,spirit of christmas,i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig. may try later. the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
1273,Positive,The Bible Made Easy,"This book takes each book of the Bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written. The author puts all the information in very understandable words. It does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place. It is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the Bible. It is more of a reference book than an ""easy read.""It is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others. Good for RCIA groups.Donna Murphy"
1274,Negative,Absurd Plot,"The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure, intrigue and excitement.But the central theme, that many core beliefs of Catholicism are at odds with the God it purports to serve, that Mary herself has repudiated such beliefs, and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs, is more than a stretch, it devolves into an anti-Catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn. This is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil Mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts, including murder and extortion. Yes, some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers, but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in ""The Godfather"" series. But if comparing the Catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea, then this book is for you."
1275,Positive,A fine read,"Steve Berry is one of those writers you love to read - from the get-go you are part of the ride. Each one of his works is a given that it will entertain, and get you thinking.Secret deals with the message the Holy Virgin gave to the children at Fatima -Has some of the grace of Angels and Demons, but not the wild ride of an ending, although a satisfactory one.Definitely worth reading."
1276,Positive,Better than The Templar Legacy or The Amber Room,"Although Berry's bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys (especially for priests) and the reveal regarding the third secret of Fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content, this yarn is similar to Dan Brown's Angels and Demons in its look at the inner workings of papal enclaves and backstage Vatican politicking. It starts just a bit slow, but has a satisfying build-up of suspense and twists so as to make it a reasonable page-turner for those who won't get too hung up on the undertone of criticism for the current Catholic church and its various doctrines. While there are some odd character choices and a bit of inconsitency about how urgent various things are and aren't along the way, I found myself entertained and turning pages and, after all, isn't that really the point of a mass market thriller? Donald J. Bingle, Author ofForced Conversion."
1277,Positive,Very entertaining,This is the first of Steve Berry's books that I've read. I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.
1278,Negative,A few minutes of horror,"There's about 15 minutes of horror film. But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting, even by Jun Ji Hyun, was dreary. The actions by the characters were dreary. The only sign of life comes from the fiancée -- a strong, dynamic performance by attractive Yu Seon.TO see Jun Ji Hyun at her best, I recommendMY SASSY GIRL,DAISY, orIL MARE."
1279,Positive,"A hair to the right, and maybe too soon","Strikes me as too soon to produce reliable history about a period so recent. He seemed a hair right-of-center but at least didn't fall into the mythology of Reagan ""winning"" the cold war. He mentions Clinton as ""slick"" a couple times but in his previous 1945-74 history I don't think (memory may be wrong) he ever used Tricky Dick or Slippery Richard about Nixon."
1280,Positive,Great Collection - Ready for more!!!,"While I'm a big fan of this collection, along with the continuing collection ""1935-1940"", I'd be really interested in knowing if JSP is planning on putting out a collection of Cab's 1940-1947 stuff. If such a collection exists from JSP & I'm just being ignorant, please let me know!"
1281,Positive,Changed my life,"there have been others books similar to this one, but nearly ALL of the authors of those books have been trained directly or indirectly by Ron LeGrand. He is truly the guru of real estate investing. This book gives solid, practical advice that works in the real world. Yes, he tries to sell you additional things, but all you have to do is follow the instructions and you will have success.A great book that opened my eyes to a world of possibilities, which included early retirement."
1282,Negative,"Stale, refund requested, but never received","The candy we received was not edible. It had long ago expired. We requested a refund, but it never came through. Avoid this vendor."
1283,Positive,THE Ultimate Food for your Lories,This is the only brand of Lory food our flock will accept. Its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
1284,Positive,Do Fish Sleep,Full of very interesting info. which we probably never needed to know Bought for a 14 year old who really liked some of his previous books.
1285,Positive,TiVo,"Got this to have at my son's house when I visit. I love it! They love it too! Easily set up, never miss a show again!!"
1286,Positive,Busy little bee!,"I like every thing about my TiVo----except---- It is so busy running around the networks finding things to record. some thimes i want to record the end of a movie or program i'm watching and i have to go into the programing an stop it from recording it has found, before i can record what I want."
1287,Negative,"If you liked getting scammed by Comcast's ""You don't have to do a thing when Digital arrives"" then you'll love the Series2","The Series2 will record only one non-digital station and one digital. Now that Comcast has gone all-digital, your Series2 has become more like a Series0.50, since it only records one channel at a time."
1288,Negative,TiVo TCD49080 Series2,"This model TiVo is out of date. It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def. You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths, then $12.95 there after.Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~$50.00?This is not only an outdated piece of equipment, but a very expensive solution to recording TV programs/movies!"
1289,Positive,"Original shipment not complete, but great service fixed it!","I ordered the TiVo and it was shipped the next day (Friday). I received it in less than a week after I ordered it. When I got it, it was missing the remote. After contacting the seller, he ordered a new remote and had it sent to me as well as a ""how-to"" book just for the inconvenience that I encountered.Very good customer service, I would order again from this seller any time."
1290,Negative,A perfect waiste of money,"When I bought the TiVo, I was told that this item would tape 2 different programs at the same time. When it didn't work, I called that company and they told me that because I had DirectTV, it was impossible to use the TiVo like I wanted to. I was totally cheated. I then bought the DirectTV's type of Digital REcorder, and it's the best thing I've ever done. It records 2 different programs at exactly the same time. TiVo told me that it only works on Cable. Bah Humbug. This is NOT explained when you want to buy the item. Buyers Beware"
1291,Negative,Return,I do not have any problems with Amazon...But I have problem with FireWallSalesNew York.I had return this TIVO almost three weeks ago. I had wrote tothem and I told them that I had sent it back due they was going to charge me$20.00 a month.I have Dish TV and they harge only me $6.00 a month. Ihad wrote to them different times to see if they got my TIVO.They writeback to tell that they will let me know.Now it's going to a month and stillhave not resolved the problem.I think that I am going to better businessin the state of New York.I am very upset with this company.They have noPride if they did they would of taken care of me......Noris
1292,Negative,Not up to par,"I have long been a fan of Muriel Spark's, truly enjoying her humor and style. I liked her autobiography as well. But this book is a great disappointment. The characters are shallow: in particular, Dr. Wolf is cardboard and scarcely believable. There is a certain sense of haste: events are barely sketched, and it is all quickly brought to a conclusion, without going into any detail. A very thin book indeed, which would probably have received much less attention if the author did not have such a reputation."
1293,Positive,Zane Grey,"I was really surprised that there was another Nevada book by Zane Grey. I had originally wanted another copy of the first book, Nevada, but when I saw this one I just had to buy it. Thanks!"
1294,Negative,Good to see that fans are keeping the place clean,"It's sad, but it happens - bootleg CDs get put up for sale on Amazon and they can't remove them fast enough. I commented on two other bootleg sales and can't find them any longer, obviously Amazon took them down and new identical ones came and took their place. Some people just don't have any shame at all.If you're going to call on Amazon to remove these CDs, you should rather suggest that they blacklist the seller, remove any means to buy the item and mark it as fake. That way, no customer would ever have to be fooled again."
1295,Negative,*Thumbs Down*,"This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself ""Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally"". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd. Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one."
1296,Negative,Judge a Book by Results,"I purchased this book over a year and a half ago, and I have yet to win big. I have studied this book from cover to cover, and use it with Lotto:How to Wheel a Fortune,also by Gail Howard. Anyone who considers purchasing either book should know that the majority of the jackpot winners in her testimonial section are from the late eighties. In theory, Lottery Master Guide appears to offer a variety of proven systems to beat the odds, but sad to say, I do not feel it lives up to its claims. I personally, would advise you to save your money and not purchase either book."
1297,Positive,The GUIDE for serious players.,"Difficult to win anything on your own. $$$ outlay by individual players is too large. Better start a pool at the office with co-workers and collect funds in order to play any of her wheeling systems. You'll share winnings and losses (small and both sides unless you hit the Jackpot). No other book comes close. Get your rabbit's foot, or any other totem for luck! You'll need it."
1298,Negative,Resie This!,"Give it up everyone, Rammstein is dead. This album is so soft it doesn't even deserve to be a German based CD. Not even Rosenrot can save this album.They have sold-out, producing a soft, nu-metal tainted record that can't compare to their other amazing albums.RIP RAMMSTEIN"
1299,Negative,What the fascination?,"Thurber revealed ""The secret Life of Walter Mitty."" DuBar should have kept his life a secret unrevealed!A lot about the drinking and useless meanderings of Jules DuBar, written in a painfully simplistic and predictable style. DuBar's life is not interesting, except in the fact that a highly educated man so often behave so coarsely. (But geologists often took pride in that kind of behavior back when. Very macho, those guys!) Save your money, or toss it in a river, but avoid this book."
1300,Negative,Not for chevy s10 pickup,"One bushing fits the other doesnt, I chose to make it fit....will implode into itself seeing as its brass and squeak to caboose but its better than your door not shutting."
1301,Negative,Incorrect parts in package,I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
1302,Positive,One of the Best Buffy Eps,Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best television show on television and if you missed the first season you can catch up on what happened now with these awsome videos. It is good formatted and is a must for a buffy fanatic like myself...all of the books are good too!
1303,Positive,Phenomenal Video!,"This is an absolutely phenomenal video account of Alaska! The videography, music, and narration combine to make this a relaxing and educational viewing experience all wrapped up in one. My family and I truly enjoyed watching this video together, and it definitely made us want to travel to Alaska at some point ourselves! Thanks for sharing your trip and obvious love and respect for our natural wonders!"
1304,Negative,"A Huge Dissapointment, Not a Complete Guide","I believe Al Ristori to be a well respected Fisherman who normally shares valuable information in a cut to the chase manner.But this book fails to live up to that reputation.It is definitely not a "" complete guide to Saltwater Fishing "".Almost all of the information presented in the book is cookie cutter and generic information that can easily be found on the net for free.This book was clearly not a labor of love and Al merely put his well know name on it to bank some coin......and has disappointed me in the process...."
1305,Negative,Publisher?,"I found the book itself to be interesting and entertaining, however I attempted to write a paper about it for school, but there is no publisher information or translator. I do not suggest this version of the book for students planning to use it in papers."
1306,Positive,A good reference for basic techniques,"I was looking for some more advanced features than were offered, but it looks like it will be helpful to me moving forward. I build alot of forms in Adobe Acrobat. If you have never done javascript in Acrobat, or have intermediate knowledge, it may be a helpfull book for you."
1307,Negative,Mixed Up,"This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one."
1308,Positive,A True Romance - One of Garwood's Best,I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. The heroine - Gillian - was full of courage and didn't back down when faced with problems. Laird Buchanen - the hero - is all man - but you can feel how much he cares for Gillian. At the same time - there are 3 or 4 other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of Gillian's main problem - will she get to see her sister? does she find the treasure? how will she get Alec to his home after he is kidnapped? who is the traitor to the Sinclairs? and more! I read this book in 2 sittings - and it left me feeling happy!
1309,Negative,Killing your dog,"In the chapter on Pets, Zahn lists ""euthanizing your companion"" as an option if ""Fido or Kitty will not take kindly- ever- to your baby."" (p103)This struck me as rather compassionless, especially for a book about parenting. She could have mentioned the possibility that some pet owners may have to find new homes for their companions, and left it at that."
1310,Positive,Wonderful,This isn't just a history book laced with photos; this is also a personal view on the Cultural Revolution from the photographer's point of view. Informative and emotional at the same time. Wonderful.
1311,Positive,Wanting to be a bombshell!,"I bought this DVD almost a year ago. I finally decided to use it and I am happy that I did. I did find the DVD very helpful, the workouts are not long and there are some rest periods throughout each workout. In my opinion workout 2 is the hardest, I am not a fan of burpees at all but they do get easier. I do not really rest during the breaks, if I need a rest I take it, if not I fast forward to the next section. Overall a great workout! I will probably get her next DVD. I am new to the kettlebell thing and I am using a 10 pound bell. This seem like just the right size for a beginner."
1312,Negative,For beginners...,"I have been a exercise dvd junkie for years, Kettlebell dvds also. Although I like the exercises presented, I have some issues with her form. I know from personal experience, if you don't have your form correct, you can cause injury to other parts of your body as I did with my knees. Also, if you're advanced, you will be working out without her instruction, as she only does the beginner workout with you. Normally, trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers. Lisa stops working out at the beginners level, which leaves you still working out by yourself, hopefully, finishing in time for the next exercise. I did pick up some good exercises but don't use this dvd as often as I would have liked. I will be sending it down the ""resell"" road."
1313,Negative,Horrible!,I can't believe how awful this movie was and I love zombie movies. It was like watching a SyFy movie of the week. Waste of $$$$. Sucked.
1314,Positive,"Good series, bad doll","Well, if you are looking for a synopsis of the series, look at disk 1.This is probably one of my faovrite animes, and it's about time they brought it to the USA.Well now the important notes. This series DVDs as with most anime series DVDs are being released every other month. The doll that comes with the set has her feminine features far to over accentuated. I think mile long legs are great, but 2-3 mile long legs. Just get the regular DVD and save yourself a 10 spot."
1315,Positive,Great for AP,"Biotutor is an invaluable tool for any student taking AP Biology or struggling in a Biology class. Last year I took regular Biology and did very well. I think my average was an A or A-. But, thinking I was such a good Biology student I took AP. It was not the same their is more math in it than I expected. But thankfully I found Biotutor and am now a great Bio student."
1316,Negative,"Old Program, Poor Tutoring","The product once installed looks like its from 1990, and all it does is quiz you. It doesn't really explain anything and it's not very interactive. [...]"
1317,Negative,waste of paper and money!,"As a list of what carts were made, it's ok. As a price guide this book is complete garbage. The prices it lists are guaranteed to get you laughed at and chased out of every video game store in America, if not the entire world."
1318,Negative,pointless documentary,I mistakenly purchased this due to the similarity with the cover and STALINGRAD - DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER. This turned out to be just a pointless documentary on STALINGRAD like so many that had gone before. My bad...
1319,Positive,Sterling Silver Hoop Charm Peace Sign Earrings,Earrings came quickly and as described. Hard to find these little peace sign earrings in a style that is not obnoxious. Perfect gift for 70's sister.
1320,Negative,Disappointed,"After reading reviews about every small wine cellar offered through Amazon, I ordered this item, hoping it would work. It arrived damaged. The cellar was sent UPS in just its original box, no extra packing to protect it. The plastic around the door was cracked. The door was also hanging at an angle. I actually considered keeping it even with the damage so I plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer. No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot. It arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine."
1321,Positive,A woman's transformation/ a professor's redemption,"Educating Rita can be enjoyed at many levels of understanding. It can simply bring pleasure and good feelings. And it can be understood as a story of love that is harnessed for the growth of each person involved in the mentoring relationship. For a woman who has to take her own journey, it is validating. For a stale and jaded teacher, it is instructive. For any love relationship that develops between student and teacher, it shows - in the very best light - what can happen to each when they recognize the true purpose of their exciting and marvelous luck in being brought into each others lives. That luck is: nothing short of the transformation of both of them.It is my wish that life could be lived more often at this level, with passion, determination, humour, guts and grace."
1322,Negative,soundtrack,can any body please tell me who made the music for the soundtrack?i want to know please tell me.thanx
1323,Positive,Most Useful,"This has become one of my most valued counseling companions. For those of you who are familiar with Glasser's Choice Theory, this is a great look into his actual practice techniques as he relates real case studies he has lead and how he has applied CT in real-life situations.Great read as well as a super resource."
1324,Positive,A full range of emotions....,"If you enjoy books that take you through the full range of emotions, I think you'll enjoy this story. It's a study of the human spirit that gives hope to all, no matter your circumstance. Full of caring, love, and compassion, the author seems to have a heart as big as Wyoming. My only wish was that the story had been longer...or that I can hope for a sequel."
1325,Negative,Horrible book...,"I had to read ""Jim the Boy"" for my freshman english course summer reading and thought that it was a horrible choice. It had no substance and was too easy to read. Although some apparently disagree, not a good choice for anyone over four years old."
1326,Positive,Poignant and beautiful,"This publication is absolutely beautiful. The stories, the pictures they all capture the unthinkable events of 9/11. I would recommend this book highly!"
1327,Positive,How to tickle your funny bone.,"If you want to spend a fun evening with someone, watchingthis DVD is the perfect way to do it. It had us both institches. Bill Engvall is funny, funny, funny and doesn'thave to use foul words to do it."
1328,Positive,Kai Hansen strikes again,"No wonder it sounds alot like Helooween. Kai Hansen, and some other former members of Helloween are in this band, which is actually a side/hobby-project for Kai Hansen and friends, disgruntled with not being able to play 80's style power metal, they formed this great band on the side of their regular bands, like Gamma Ray and other bands.Also worth noting is the fact that they've just released a 4-track mini-CD, ""Coming Home."" I bought it only yesterday, and it, needless to say, ROCKS! There's a live version of ""Atlantis is Falling"". The cover of Judas Priest's ""The Rage"" is also terrific."
1329,Positive,What! What! No Limits on the rise again!,"Easily one of the dopest cds of the year 2000, but it'll probably get slepped on, because the haters are in full effect when it comes to No Limit. This cd can be listened to from the begining to the end without skipping a single song. The beats are excellent, even without Beats by the pound, the new production team is holding their own. You got to feel C-Murders maturity on this cd, hes taking his game to a whole other level. K-blaque----puttin it down for NoLimitsoldiers.com"
1330,Negative,EXPECTS TO MUCH FROM THE READER.. NOT GOOD FOR BEGINERS,THE BOOK COVERS A LOT OF STUFF AT ONCE IT SHOULD BE CALLED LEARNING TO PROGRAM THE HARD WAY DONT RECOMMEND FOR BEGINNERS MEABY JUST MEABY FOR ADVANCED PROFESSORS ..SORRY MY OPNION..DONT RECOMMEND IT TO LEARN FROM IT AS FIST VB BOOK AND BY THE WAY THE AUTHOR HAS A LOT OF GREAT BOOKS THE FIRST ONE I THINK WAS BETTER
1331,Positive,Rockin' Scandinavians,"I heard this group on the radio and had to have their cd, which I like very much. My only disappointment is that my favorite track, Sinklars vise, is incomplete. The singer is cut off midsentence and it was a longer song on the radio. Even though I can't understand the words, the rhythms are mesmerizing."
1332,Negative,Horrible ending,"I was totally enthralled by this entire series, even the Sherlock Holmes style story of Stonecutter but this ending was horrible. Took a perfectly good sword and sorcery series and turned it sci-fi. I'll read sci-fi when I want that, I read this series for magic and swordplay. I'd read the entire series again and simply leave this one out."
1333,Positive,An Excellent Edition of Sesame and Lilies,"This is an excellent edition of John Ruskin's Sesame and Lilies, the best I have found. The editors have not gone footnote-crazy; there are fortunately few. Supplementary materials such as the intro, chronology and glossary are well done and interesting, and the critical essays included are varied and very much worth reading. This ed. is part of Yale's ""Rethinking the Western Tradition"" series, all of which are well done."
1334,Positive,Outstanding,"Marriott was the man, and deserves to be remembered, but the fact that he was one of the best R&B vocalists this country's ever produced means anyone trying to do his songs justice is probably, with all the best intentions, going to struggle. Steve Ellis comes closest to hitting the notes, the best of his tracks being Song Of A Baker. Dennis Greaves, Simon ""Honeyboy"" Hickling, and Midge Ure all perform well. Both the tracks by Deborah Bonham are outstanding, in particular (If You Think You're) Groovy, which is easily the best thing on the album. The tracks by Weller/Gallagher/McLagen et al are good, but you'd expect better. As for Tony Rivers ripping the throat out of Itchycoo Park, the less said about it the better.Review in brief: Good Tracks - 18 out of 21. Best Track: (If You Think You're) Groovy, Deborah Bonham. Worst Track: Itchycoo Park, Tony Rivers. Worth buying? Yes, because the good tracks make up for the bad ones."
1335,Positive,"If you are a entrepreneur, you must read this book","I wanted to start my own business, but I knew nothing about entrepreneurship. After reading this book, I feel confident about my new business venture. It is impossible to explain how valuable a tool this book is."
1336,Positive,Anecdotes help illustrate the practical and important ideas,"4 Secrets Of High Performing Organizations: Beyond The Flavor Of The Month To Lasting Results is a ""user friendly"" business manager's guide that emphasizes the importance of not falling into business or marketing ""fads"". Instead, business managers and supervisors can establish profitable and efficient organizations by using basic, solid principles of dialogue with the folks who really know what's going on, by keeping things clear and open, by effectively measuring success and excellence, and by balancing cost vs. quality. An extraordinary presentation of ""common sense, uncommon wisdom"" is presented in a straightforward, no-nonsense manner. Anecdotes help illustrate the practical and important ideas in this highly recommended instructional reference designed specifically for anyone having a responsibility at any level for the success and profitability of a business enterprise."
1337,Negative,ATTENTION HISTORY LOVERS,"For all of you that like English History with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella, THE DAUGHTER OF TIME by Josephine Tey. This is a mystery novel that deals a lot with English History and Old Kings and stuff, whic is something that I just don't mesh with. On a scale of one to ten I would have to rate this book a three. The reading was a bit hard, and I often found myself counting the pages until I was finished. Though I usually love mystery, this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels. The book was written well and I think that if I had been a tad bit older and wiser on English History that I may have enjoyed it more. Overall I think that I would personally have to give the book two thumbs down."
1338,Positive,This highly surprising telling....,...of one of the oldest mysteries in England was thoroughly enjoyable. The story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery. Until I read another theory on these two little princes I find more believable I'll stick with this one!
1339,Positive,"Well-written, thought-provoking, British mystery.","I've given away at least a dozen copies. I don't want to spoil anyone's delight in reading, but I will say that the content remains controversial. Debby Goldstein"
1340,Positive,Give Tey a try.,"Did Richard III have the princes in the Tower ""done in?"" That is one of the great mysteries of history, and Tey ""solves"" it in the Daughter of Time. Some critics consider this the greatest mystery novel ever written, and I concur. Have read hundreds of mysteries, many of them marvelous,but The Daughter of Time is the best.There are those who think Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is best. I don't because I had correctly figured out who the murderer was by page 2."
1341,Positive,Mystery for history buffs (or a history for mystery buffs),"Josephine Tey takes us through a wonderful unraveling of centuries old history. Was Richard III the evil murderer of the princes -- or not?I think this book one of the most fascinating mixes of history and mystery (two of my favorite areas) and reread it regularly. So when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery, this was an easy choice (backed up by it's ranking as one of Amazon's best mysteries of the Century). Well, they hated it. Why bother solving a centuries old mystery? So I offer this experience to say that this is a terrific book if you like mysteries or English history. Others may not care for it."
1342,Positive,"A ""big"" short read","Wonderfully written and hugely educational, taking the reader from the theory of historical evidence to the stories of King Richard III"
1343,Negative,poor quality,These pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area. For this price I would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months.
1344,Negative,Ripped off.,"I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband's birthday. Within a week, all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs. I paid $160 dollars for these pajamas, more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon, expecting I was buying quality. After a week's use, they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded."
1345,Negative,Very disappointed,"This arrived in a different package and bottle than shown. The box has tear marks and is beat up. It also has a nasty, dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed. What a great looking Christmas gift this will make."
1346,Negative,Paper feed nightmare,"I just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed. Not long after I bought this model (but too late to return)it started having problems with the paper feed. I now have to hand feed each piece of paper, and even then it sometimes doesn't work. The print quality is fine, but what good is it if you can't get the paper in. I now have to replace this ""new"" printer. That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted."
1347,Negative,yes total waste of money,"This is the second HP printer I bought and frankly the only reason I tried this printer was because of the network connectivity. I haven't written many reviews before, but this product is soo bad that I had to add to the list of angry customers. Getting the printer to load 1 piece of paper is a nightmare. Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine. Anyone see office space? yeah after I get my new Canon printer, i will re-enact that scene. perhaps i should record it and send it to HP?"
1348,Negative,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I have actually not yet had the paper feed issue like the rest of the reviewers, but this product has been horribly implemented. I have continually had issues with attempting to install the 160+ MB driver and HP Solution Center software on multiple different computers running different Operating Systems. The scanner is about worn out, as it makes a horrible grinding noise when scanning which started to occur within months of the purchase. HP used to be known for their great quality in printers, but this is unfortunately no longer the case. Do Not Buy."
1349,Negative,"Paper jams, bloated driver, shutdowns","To begin, the software installation is a headache. I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT. Why do you need a 40MB - 200MB driver that requires you to turn off your Anti-virus during installation?! The printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing. While I think HP business grade printers are great, this consumer grade printer is junk."
1350,Negative,"Yes, the paper does not feed correctly!","I am in complete agreement with the rest of you who have had paper feeding problems. The printer was fine at first although difficult to set up (software). Now, a month later, the printer either doesn't take the paper or jams. It has nothing to do with the quality of the paper. I am also surprised that this wasn't discovered in testing. I also noticed that the ink cartridges keep getting smaller. What a rip off. I have had it with HP printers. I will never buy another."
1351,Negative,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"I bought this movie new, but it will not play on my DvD player. I have tried several other players/machine to play this in & it will not work in any of them. I am very disappointed with this product. When I was looking at it on Amazon, it didn't say it was not compatable with any system."
1352,Negative,no,Why did you send a dvd that you are very sure it does not work here in The United States? Does it make any sense for you? Why don't ask us to be sure before send it to another Country? If you know that it won't work on that Country?
1353,Negative,Idk,It doesn't play in normal DVD players. So idk where I could watch it. I was looking forward to watching it.
1354,Positive,Took My Breath Away,"Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating just a little. Maybe it didn't exactly take my breath away, but it is an incredible DVD. This is a real good movie, however ""not exactly a phenomenon"" as Steven Speilberg claims in a brief interview on the DVD. The DVD in itself with all the extra bonus materials is outstanding. I found it to be very informative and very interesting to see how this movie was made and just how much dedication and extremely hard work it took just to get all the years-worth animation included with the live-action, get it produced, make countless sketches, and finally get it out to the theaters. Well done. Very well done. I couldn't be more pleased and more impressed with this special DVD release. It's definitely a must-have."
1355,Positive,Five stars aint nothin'. I'd Give it 10000 If I could,"My Grandmother bought this for me when I was 2 years old. I've loved since then. I havent watched it in a while so I decided to watch it one day when nothing was interesting on T.V. This movie bought back so many memories of when me, my cousins (who I havent spoken to since i was 8) and friends were little. I knew every song and every line. Get this movie. It's a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids. You wont regret buying this."
1356,Positive,Hooked on the Brothers!,"Super Mario Bros. is a video game movie that is memorable in the way that may surprise you. The witty dialogue and rapport between Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as Mario and Luigi, respectively, make this film a real treat upon repeated viewings. Although it features a look that may remind people more of Blade Runner than Super Mario Bros., it has the same charm in its set design that other 1990s science-fiction films have, such as Total Recall or Demolition Man. The tone shifts all over the place from light and comedic to dark and frightening, but the sheer inventiveness on display here make Super Mario Bros. worth a watch. Dennis Hopper gives a performance straight out of a David Lynch film in this one. Watch this flick and I guarantee you'll be hooked on the brothers!"
1357,Negative,One of the worst movies ever made!,"OK, I'm not going to get into this movie's lack of similarities to the video games;this movie just plain sucks. I can't see why anybody over the age of twelve can enjoy this piece of you know what. Come on, this movie has horrible acting, a dreadfully bad story and ""hilariously"" unfunny jokes. I think you people who gave this movie five stars really need professional help, 'cause one star is far too generous. I'm not saying all the media incarnations of mario sucked;the cartoons were actually pretty good. But this movie, in my opinion is what caused that chain of cartoons to end."
1358,Positive,A misunderstood and fun film.,"Not much I can say except that this movie is often riffed on for all the wrong reasons.Yes, the movie is indeed flawed in many respects. But at the same time, it has a lot of great set pieces, music, good dialogue, good CG and animatronics, and a a scene using Joe Satroni music.It's just a fun movie, worth riffing on if you hate it, but a fun movie if you appreciate it for exactly what it is supposed to be, a fun ride."
1359,Negative,Could have been better!,"I am a big fan of the Super Mario Brothers - the video game and the TV show. I had high hope for this movie, but boy what a waste of time this was. This movie sure give the Super Mario Brothers a bad name. If you haven't seen this movie, I envy you. Nothing like the game of the show. It NEVER should have been made; period."
1360,Positive,"good, Its GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!(Jim Carrey voice)",I saw this movie way back when it came out in the theaters but that was so long ago so when I seen it on Amazon I had to get it to see if it was as good as i remember it and it was better. I tell you it is hard to even take it from the player. I think it's really good. Dennis Hopper does a great job as Koopa and the Mario Bros. are great. And for those of you who might think that the princess's name should be Peach not Daisy you are a little off the page. The character of Daisy first shows up in Super Mario Land as Luigi's girl while Peach is Mario's. DUH!!
1361,Negative,flawed concept,"Here's my problem: While I do think we create a lot of our own problems in this life, I don't think every single situation in life is one of our own creation. To me, saying that we create everything in our lives through our ""thought vibrations"" is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly. Our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs? Really? So, for example, the Jews killed during the Holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy? Granted, what the author is really talking about is MUCH smaller situations in our everyday lives, ones we can control. But still, this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me. Also, I was looking for more concrete ""how to"" information, which I found a bit lacking in this book. I know the author was going for simplicity, but I found the illustrations and exercises a bit too simplistic and not terribly helpful."
1362,Positive,Pity the Fool who Don't Buy This,"The best part about the A-Team (besides no one getting hurt, the homemade weapons, the Team member's personalities, and the bad badguys) was the music. From the intro, to Face srenading his girl-du-jour, or Murdock talking to his invisible dog, to B.A. helping out at the Youth Center, to the raging firefights and homemade weapons, to the end credits, the music in A-Team was always appropriate for the setting, and always good. I love it when a soundtrack comes together!"
1363,Negative,Rosemary's Baby,This dvd came from England & would not play on my player so I have returned it & I am waiting on a credit. I would not have ordered this had I know it was coming from England & that I might have a problem
1364,Positive,I loved everything about this movie,The acting is fantastic. Direction outstanding. Chilling in every sense of the word. I love this movie! One of my top ten.
1365,Positive,A Face Only A Mother Could Love !!,"Yes, Devil Conspiracy at it's finest..this is a true 1960ish classic and another epic from Roman Polanski.How the lifestyle of Doris Day becomes satanic..This Devil worship genre was heavy stuff in the mid 1960's coming as it did with the saga of Sharon Tate, Charles Manson and Polanski somehow tied into all of this.Nonetheless murder is murder and this movie is the depiction of darkness, Lucifer, evil with the premise of the birth of the antichrist.Rosemary herself (a witch not by choice), battles endlessly with herself and her emotions as if reason could win.... This movie blurs all distinction between madness and reality as seen through the eyes of Rosemary.A truly remarkable groundbreaking flick that contrasts good and evil, passion and reason, a highly entertaining movie with a a great cast of future stars.The extras are good."
1366,Positive,Michael sings the classics,"These are the best-known ""hits"" from the best-loved shows -- the songs you go home humming -- and Michael's gorgeous and evocative voice really delivers the goods. Love this tour of great moments on stage."
1367,Positive,Unbelieveable video and interesting stories,"Unlike most of the reviews here, I was able to play this HD DVD without any problems. I use my Xbox 360 to play HD DVDs, which is able to automatically get any updates that are needed.Anyway, the movie follows the stories of multiple Italian people, all of different ages and background, as they embark on different milestones in their lives. The video is full of beautiful shots with great hi-def detail. The narration really adds to the video as none of the people speak English.I definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Italy. My wife and I went there a few years ago and were happy to once again see places that we had visited."
1368,Negative,Wish I had read the reviews ...,"These videos are fantastic from a documentary perspective, but someone on the manufacturing crew screwed up the Italy & Austrailia disks. DO NOT BUY until the problem is fixed ... you'll just have to send them back."
1369,Negative,Disappointed,"I only wish that more time was devoted to the natural beauty of Italy and its cities,towns and natural coutryside, particulary in the north, as opposed to horse racing, auto racing etc."
1370,Negative,FIRMWARE FIXED IT,I just updated to the newest firmware (1.5 4/12/2007) and the disc is now PLAYABLE in my XA2. Big relieve for all I hope. Review of the source to follow.
1371,Negative,Does not work.,Read the reviews about this disk not working. Figured they were old reviews and had fixed the problems. Very disappointed in that they are still selling this defective disk. Brand new XBox HD DVD player refuses to boot with this.
1372,Positive,"Good CD Player, but third-rate headphones.","This CD player is a great one when it comes to travel and portability. But only four months after I got it, the headphones stopped working (properly). When they do work, they don't work on the left side, and you usually have to play around with it before it does. But still, it's a great system. Nice audio quality, too."
1373,Positive,"Detailed, but not to much.","I was impressed with how Mr. Philbrick was able to share just the right amount of detail. When reading the narrative of the canniblaism I was just about to shout, enough! when he stopped. The book flowed well and was never boring. The explanations of whaling and the culture, both in Nantucket and on ship, were well done. The sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life. I appreciated the Epilogue, but felt the extensiveness of the Notes were unnecessary. It was already evident that much research had gone into this book. This book is certainly not for everyone. those who are looking for a love story will not find it here. It is a true story about people coping in an extreme situation and what they feel they must resort to."
1374,Positive,A SEA AND SURVIVAL STORY OF EPIC PROPORTIONS,"This true story takes place in the early to middle 1800's and its location on Nantucket Island and in the middle of nowhere..asea. You learn that looking for whales is a group effort and when one is found, a grueling and dangerous activity to land it. The ship Essex was sunk by a whale and that was the inspiration for writing Moby Dick. It is most interesting reading about the survival of a few and how they eventually made it back to land. A pageturner."
1375,Positive,Riveting Story of Survival (and Death) at Sea,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation, thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the Pacific back to South America. Philbrick's writing is clear, powerful and incredibly engaging. It's a hard book to both put down and get out of your mind after finishing it."
1376,Positive,Inside the Whalers,"Philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other, and explains each wave along the way. I couldn't put it down. I had a special interest in that my great-great-grandfather was a whaling captain (""Master""), and traveled those waters with my great-grandfather as a toddler on board. My one criticism of the author's perspective is what he didn't critique - cannibalism! I know it is easy to point fingers when I was not there, starving and dying of thirst, but the author went too far in the other direction and became their justifiers, based on the accounts of two survivors who chose to eat their friends. Why was there not a serious discussion about chosing to die with dignity rather than deify life at the cost of eating and drinking your friends? Perhaps the men who died earlier did hold to this. Why was that not a significant part of this work?Nevertheless, thank you Nate Philbrick for a book that should be made into a movie, with some of this balance."
1377,Positive,great historical account of good and bad leadership,"a bare facts historical account of the sinking of the Essex by a sperm whale and the enfolding events after that. The failure of the captain led to unnecessary loss of life when he gave in to his first mate's influence to sail east in the small whaleboats, in spite of his own gut feeling that they should sail west. We may not like some of the decisions they made in order that some of them might have the chance to stay alive, but we until we are in their shoes we cannot be judgmental.great book"
1378,Positive,What a wonderful Story,What a wonderful and often time touching story. It is very hard to believe what those men went thru. They were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured. I recommend this book to everyone. Especially those who think that they have is bad.
1379,Positive,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex.,The condition is somewhat less than perfect -- but not much.The book is wonderful. Fascinating story and Very well researched and written.
1380,Positive,The sinking of the whale ship Essex,"This book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period. Their adventure on the ship Essex as it left port sailing for new grounds . Little was know about the islands of the Pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives. Some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship mates.Their lives, after their rescue, I found interesting in the way that they personally found solace in the jobs theytook up.I would recommend this book. It was the chosen book by our Book Club of women and all found it interesting ."
1381,Positive,How does this novel stack up with the Penguin Version?,"I haven't read this book, but I was wondering how this book stacks up with the Penguin version 'The Loss of the Whale Ship Essex, Sunk By A Whale?' From what I understand, this novel is a retelling of events while the Penguin Classics is the actual accounts of two of the crew members? I'm a bit torn as to which one I should read/purchase. All comments are very much appreciated."
1382,Positive,An Exciting Tale of Survival,"The sinking of the Essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick but in In the Heart of the Sea (The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex) by Nathaniel Philbrick, the reader will be engaged in an adventure more exciting than most works of fiction. The author skillfully combines elements from the accounts of two survivors to locate the truth of the tale. In addition, one will become immeresed in the history of Nantucket, the whaling industry (including graphic accounts of the hunt not for the faint hearted), and other elements of this particular place and time in history. An exciting read and a fine speciman of that popular creature, the true survival story. Highly recommended."
1383,Positive,Poetry with a knack for memorable imagery.,"Paul Hoover is an experienced and successful poet having published six earlier books of award winning poetry. Totem And Shadow: New and Selected Poems continues to document his impressive talent wedded to an innate knack for memorable imagery. After Miss Graven's Remarks: Boy, my left eye cries when I see kids/play violins and things. How did they get/so young? And I can't stop my fractures/when they strike toy xylophones in a song/too sentimental, mechanical sugarplum fairies./It's brutal of them t kill me with growing up/like this, and Mrs. Pollen, who tends them,/why is she so kind under her matronly woolens?/What is so appealing in a clumsy, fuzzy/third-grader, ghostly in polyester as any/sad adult? Sure, there's no god to do it,/but they should have bright violent minds/to brace them for a while, and one tough look/keep them when Christmas isn't the mood."
1384,Negative,Not the real thing,I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the amazingly low price for this product. I guess I got what I paid for since these pills did not work at all. The ingredients list the same as Phazyme but offered no relief.
1385,Positive,A sports world comedy sporting two wonderful stars,Hepburn and Tracy at their finest in the story of a female athlete and her shady agent. An agent who turns out to be a good guy when he finds the right woman in the guise of Hepburn. Hepburn got to display her range of athletic skills in this film alongside some of the great female golfers and men and women tennis stars of the 1950's.Great film.
1386,Negative,Yuck,"I must respectfully disagree with the 5 star rating for this CD. The reason being is that I have never heard such muck up of Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"". I have to admit I bought this CD purely for Piazzolla's ""4 Seasons"" and now I am convinced that I definitely must search for a different performance of it, being almost certain that this one is not doing it justice."
1387,Negative,Still a Mystery,"Anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of Sufism should not turn to this book. This book, in fact, does not examine anything of intellectual, spiritual, or social value as related to Sufism or Islam. I have come across many books written by so-called Sufi Masters, who expound upon the complexity of the universe with inspirational imagery. This is not one of them. While books in this genre easily turn into polemics, this one surely takes the unenlightened cake. The stream of consciousness writing style lacks purpose in this setting and appears to have been an 'easy way out' of organizing a coherent book of ideology."
1388,Positive,Great book,"Very good book. Quick read, good story and beautiful illustrations. Got this for myself to read, but am going to have my 9yr old read it as well."
1389,Positive,Works great! love it!,I was able to easily search for a wireless network and set up my Tivo to my wireless internet! Works flawlessly!
1390,Positive,TiVo wireless adapter,If you can't connect your TiVo using an Ethernet cord then this is the next best thing. This is the only wireless adapter that you should using if you own a TiVo. This adapter was specifically design for TiVo.
1391,Positive,Tivo Wireless Adapter,Making Tivo apart of my wireless network was easy to do and now I can watch what is on either Tivo no matter which room I am in.
1392,Positive,Great Buy,Bought this item for half or what a local computer store wanted. Worked right out of the box. Very good product.
1393,Positive,TiVo wireless adaptor,"Quick to ship and arrive, price better than from TiVo. Only annoyance is that TiVo requires a specialized wireless G USB adaptor."
1394,Positive,Works as it should,"Got it, opened it, plugged it in, entered my net info, and Bob's your flippin' Mother's sister's brother!"
1395,Positive,Tivo wireless adapter,"Great product, works extremely well. My modem is in my basement and the adapter is upstairs. I get an 85% signal strength. Highly recommend."
1396,Negative,not too compatible with iMac,"the set-up requirement for the Tivo wireless connector to my Apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network. When Tivo worked on the network, my printer didn't. It was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in."
1397,Negative,wasted my money,I spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network. Went through the steps a bazillion times . It found my network and could not get an IP address ( after WEP key entered). Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything. Their final suggestion was call your ISP (Comcast) who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant. Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would!
1398,Positive,Wireless is the way to go!,"This little gizmo works as promised. It's great if you want to transfer shows from one TV to another in your house. You can also download programs to your laptop providing you have TiVo to Go Plus. I'll never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane again.It took me a little time to figure out that in the ""setting up"" stage of connecting your adapter, you weren't supposed to enter the router's password but rather the complicated encryption key."
1399,Positive,Works.,"Easy installation. Tivo has a rating of reception, and I couldn't get it to go more than 50-58%. But it still works."
1400,Positive,It works,This wireless adapter is the only one that worked right for my Tivo. I had bought one at Radio Shack of a different brand and it did not work at all. But the TiVo Adapter was easy to plug in and set up. I have been able to watch online movies through netflix and now I don't need to plug in the ethernet cord to the modem/router.
1401,Positive,Real Plug and Play,"Plugged it in and my Series 2 DT popped up a config screen, entered my WPA password and I was good to go. Simple set and good range."
1402,Positive,It works,Not too much to say about this adapter. It does what it's supposed to. Sure an N adapter would be better but even the G is over priced.
1403,Positive,Great product!,Easy to setup without having to read the manual (haha) and works great without having to worry about compatibility problems.
1404,Positive,Works perfectly and a great price.,Short and sweet. Had it working flawlessly for 2 weeks now. No problems at all.
1405,Positive,Great price and works perfect,I paid less and got the exact same Tivo wireless adapter as sold by Tivo. I have had no problems and now I get updates and download shows to my computer without any cables..
1406,Positive,Tivo Wirelss G,"Ordered on same day as Tivo but came 8 - 10 days later. Caused a delay in hooking up. It would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time, especially when one unit is dependant on the other. Unit dropped off line after the first installation and had to be rebooted. Seems to be OK now.This is my first Tivo and adapter so I have nothing to compare this product with."
1407,Positive,Works with my Pioneer DVR-810H,I had purchased another wireless network adapter that wouldn't work for my DVR (approx. 4+ yrs old now). This TiVo adapter connected and works great. Saved a lot of cash too by purchasing through Amazon instead of TiVo directly...
1408,Negative,Died 12/29/09 purchased 3/2007,"I have 4 Tivo's in the house and each uses a different type of WiFi adaptor. I bought the Tivo AG0100 to connect my Series 2 to my Linksys Router in 2007 to replace a Linksys adaptor to get better speed. Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and died suddenly. I giving two stars because it did not last very long. The other WiFi adaptors (Linksys and Microsoft) are still working and they are older. I do want to note that the Tivo WiFi adaptor runs hot, while the others are not even warm."
1409,Positive,Great product and easy to use!,"We unpacked this small module, plugged it into the TiVo, followed the on-screen instructions, and we were set up within 15 minutes. We cancelled our landline telephone service, not considering that our TiVo subscription required dial-up access. We ordered this product right away, and it arrived within 3 days, and was simple to set up. So far, no problems!"
1410,Positive,"I like Hardy, but I loved the Mayor","I like this story the most of Hardy's works. An interesting tale with some good, realistic characters. I think I'll read it again."
1411,Positive,I liked this book.,"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the ""evils"" of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"
1412,Negative,Dubious creation,"There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit,with the true author's approval however, for this book that John Demires actually entirely wrote. The book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of New Orleans' novel attractions."
1413,Positive,Hard questions....Real Answers,"This book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible. Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion, Jesus, and God and take a look at it in a most unique way. I went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist Christian and found myself following the argument of Reverend Teel and even, at moments, agreeing with him. While I certainly don't agree with all of the points he brings out, he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers. He asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end I was moved by the book, I'm recommending it to all of my friends."
1414,Negative,Snooz-a-pa-looza,"Total waste of celluloid, not to mention time, money etc. Not entertaining at all. Not creative at all. Not artistic in the least. Absolutely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something provocative. The viewer gets to accompany someone, who resembles Cobain, for an uneventful, boring walk in the woods and a mission to avoid any contact with anyone else. The only thing that kept me from ejecting the DVD was my faith in ole Gus. I kept saying to myself,"" this can't be all there is to this film."" I kept waiting until even all the credits had rolled, as if there would be some surprise or explanation for wasting all that film. SNORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE!"
1415,Negative,horrible!!!,"I have to say that I am a pretty big Kurt fan. I was excited when this movie came out because I felt it might actually be pretty good. The only good thing I can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi-like Kurt, and thats it!! It was a def. bummer and I had to pull myself through it!! I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone!! Hes a great artist with a great band! The legend should be left to rest in peace!! Kurt's probably turning in his grave over this. If you have ever read anything about him you would know this is not what he would have wanted!! All in all take my word for it, this is a waste of money and time!!"
1416,Negative,Worst.movie.ever.,"Absolute worst movie that I have ever seen, I never write movie reviews but this was so bad and hopelessly boring that I felt obligated to say something......Heres the movie: Guy stumbles around his house mumbling to himself in a dress with a shotgun...treated to a full boyz2men video on a tv...guy stumbles around and sits in a greenhouse mumble mumble...silence and camera focused on a bush for 2 mins...guys drunk friends come to his house guy plays a song 2 guys kiss and lay on eachother in bed...guy makes mac and cheese....guy dies in his greenhouse.....awesome movie....makes me want to watch dude wheres my car"
1417,Negative,What a waste!,"Unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of Kurt Cobains life. Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn't. Let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man. Merely this movie was from someone who watched ""The Doors"" too many times. What a waste, another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career. I'd recommend buying any album from Nirvana if you want to know the true singer in the shadows."
1418,Negative,Dissapointed...,"I caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater. I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be. I'm sorry, Michael Pitt is the wrong choice to play Kurt Cobain (even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician). The trouble is, I don't think anyone could really play Kurt. I suppose there are people in this movie (Kim Gordan of Sonic Youth and the director Gus Van Sant) who actually knew Kurt while he was alive, so they know something I don't obviously. Regardless of the mis-casting, in my opinion, the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless. We already know how it's going to end (like with ""Elephant"") but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes. I admire Van Sant's lofty goal to create a piece of cinema to attribute to my hero Kurt, but it just falls short in the end."
1419,Negative,Difficult Read,"This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled, I keep losing track of which character is being talked about. I have read and reread the story, but still have difficulty summarizing the story. The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow. Use caution when reading this story."
1420,Negative,An Insult to the English Language,"I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust."
1421,Negative,Don't waste your money - buy 3rd edition used.,"The back cover states ""Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition"". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7, the Pictorial Atlas, is unchanged. And I suspect the same will be true for the 4 online practice exams. Bottom line - buy the 3rd edition used for about $2 and save yourself $60. Still, this book is ok for FP boards as is Swanson's."
1422,Negative,Great for Novices who want to stay that way,"Elaine and Peter are career authors. They obviously don't use the products they write about, and this book is no exception. It is lacking in common sense, good advice, and practical tips and techniques. This series tends to be quite good overall, but the authors' obvious unfamiliarity with the product they are writing about shines through vividly.If that weren't bad enough, many of the examples are poor quality and look bitmapped! In a vector book! Shame!"
1423,Negative,Expected more...,"not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ... I would say not half good. I can say they have great talent, but artistically ... wrong managed. Stopped watching after 30 min."
1424,Positive,High Energy Performance,"These women ROCK! This is a wonderful performance by 4 very talented string musicians. It is impossible to watch this video and not start dancing, or at the least, tapping your feet. I enjoy watching it while I'm cooking--really gets me in a festive mood. Highly recommend it if you enjoy up-tempo, contemporary music."
1425,Positive,"Didn't quite live up to expectations, but still enjoyable","As musicians, Bond really stands out, even on this DVD, but as show-women, they need a lot of work. Haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog. And as a group, they didn't do much in the way of actual ""entertaining"". They simpy played their music. It may possible that it was planned that way....consider the British audience....but if that was the case, they should have recorded some other performance for release on DVD. In short, if you are a fan of Bond, you will want this, but don't expect too much from it."
1426,Negative,Useless for Home theatre or TV show.,"This product is good for UK only. To play in USA you need to find a DVD player which has capability for changing Region Code to UK and that you may be able to do it on computer but not on DVD player in USA. I order it in USA, prodact came from Uk and I couldn't play it on my most advanced DVD player."
1427,Positive,Wonderful Techniques!,"I am now a devoted Jean Warren fan! 1-2-3 Math is great for the under 5 set! I have two children, 4 and 2, and they both have gained so much from the easy activities in this book!"
1428,Positive,Solid overall,"Helmut Rilling does well with large scale works of Bach, which is a plus on the B Minor Mass. Everything is well articulated, with solid bass lines (often lacking in ""authentic"" performances). He captures the faith aspect very well. His ""crucifixus"" is the best I have heard in capturing the pain of the cross, followed by the brilliant contrast of ""et resurrexit"". He has an excellent cast of soloists. It flows well, but has a very slight feel of heavy-footedness. It has none of the dance quality so prominent in the Mauersberger recording (Rudolf Mauersberger one of few who can bring out both dance and devotion). Overall, most people who are not too much into ""Historically Informed"" would find this quite satisfying."
1429,Positive,Excellent Service,I order the water shoes and was very pleased with my purchase. It is excatly what I wanted and I got it in no time flat. I was a little hesitant about ordering on line but this experience was well worth it..
1430,Positive,"Well made, but runs a little small","Five-star rating for the quality of the product, but they run small. I ordered a large and it was just too small for me. I wear 36"" pants comfortably, although I measure 38"" around my waist at its thickest point. My thigh is 25"" at its thickest point, and I measure 41"" around my butt."
1431,Negative,used to be good,"I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago. my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . won't be buying again"
1432,Negative,Wrong size,I have no idea how good or bad this item is. Amazon advertised size M for this item and I ordered it. When it came it was S. and I didn't know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size. When I looked it was a S. I had thrown all the papers away so I am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale I have or someone has.
1433,Positive,Works as Advertised,"No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention. Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your ""area"" may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear. Once you remember to do that, you're set!"
1434,Negative,Dumping it down the drain,"This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy, gassy, and spit up like crazy. Not only did I hate to see them screaming with discomfort, but it was the hardest day I've had yet as a new mom to twins. Yes, I said ""day."" I took MMP as directed for only one day. The babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply. I cut out the MMP and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again. I'm pretty sure it's the blessed thistle that caused the issues. I tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues, although not anywhere near the degree as with MMP. I hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted, but I didn't find anything about effects similar to my experience so I felt the need to share."
1435,Negative,"Original poem not used, images were of modern players","There are several altered versions of Thayer's classic poem in existance.This book uses one of them.I love this poem, and I wish the author had stuck with the original.Especially when Ernest Lawrence Thayer is listed as the author!Also- the images of Casey and the spectators are of modernday participants. Casey is wearing a helmet and his name andnumber are on the back of his uniform. Not like a playerin 1888 at all.Leroy Neiman is a great artist, and that is the only reason I give this2 stars."
1436,Negative,This seems like an excuse to get Hester back on the battlefield.,"Not one of the stronger entries in the series, SLAVES OF OBSESSION suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series. Far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between Union and Confederate issues; battles better detailed in many other works, and not enough on developing a strong narrative. The trip to America for Monk and Hester to recapture an American and his runaway English teen on a charge of murder is relatively ridiculous and only serves as an opportunity for Perry to showcase Hester's nursing ability. It's an interesting scene, but really just fills pages and does not move the narrative forward. Even the mystery's solution resolution left me less than satisfied, a perfunctory ending to a pedestrian entry in the series."
1437,Negative,maya,"I loved the cover when I saw it, and I was very excited to receive it. I like this artists music, but was not too thrilled with this CD. It was not what I thought it would be, and very ""jungle like"""
1438,Positive,A Lesson in Human Tragedy,"This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about "" a stranger killing my old dog"" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does. This is a beautiful book!"
1439,Negative,Of Mice and Men! More like Manly Mice!,"I found several critical problems with this play, including narrative structure, plot thematics, metaphorical irony, and satirical narcissism. Serious scholars need not apply. The books are not for the people to do with Lenny and Carl. Shooting the tragedy in the end is an unfortunate incident for the lives of everyone on the earthen structures. If you're good looking for Steinbeck, I suggest the ""Rapes of Wrath."""
1440,Positive,Read this book!!,I thought that Of Mice and Men was a pretty good book. It told a story of a relationship between two friends. If you don't like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read. Otherwise it was really good.
1441,Positive,A Simple Story That Says So Much,"Short, but marvelous. That's Of Mice and Men in three words, but that nutshell does extreme injustice to the true wonder of this classic.Through this tale, John Steinbeck was able to say so much, in so little words. Never before have I seen so many themes bonded so seemlessly together, without being boring and flat. No, Of Mice and Men was enjoyable, and I would never mind reading it again. I will never forget Of Mice and Men, for it has found its own special place in my heart, and forever there it will remain."
1442,Positive,"Lexi A.W., student of Maces Lane Middle School the best book I have ever read","Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was the best book I have ever read. The characters, the mentally retarded Lennie and the tough George, are on the run from people from Weed. Lennie was accused of trying to rape a girl in a red dress when he actually wanted to touch it since it was so soft. After that, they find a ranch in Salinas, California to work on for a while. There are conflicts and solutions all at the same time.My favorite character was Lennie because even though, he was really mentally retarded, he was kind and did nothing out of harm. He knew that George loved him by giving tough love while on the ranch. All he thought about was the rabbits. ""I get to tend the rabbits"" was my all time favorite quote because he always said it to remind himself what he was going to do when they got off the farm. Sometimes, I always thought he was rather hopeful even when he was sad."
1443,Positive,Of mice and men - Izzy G,"Of mice and men was a great book. It told about how and little man named, George who was smart and a dumb man, Lennie who was really big and strong. This book explained how the one man helps out another guy that isnt smart at all and just needs taking caring of because his Aunt Clara died. Well while they both keep working on the fields Bucking Barley, they come up with an idea to own a house and a couple of acres. Well Lennie loves to rub soft things, so he wants to just get the house and tend the rabbits. The book is just a good book of how good of friends can work together and when something goes wrong a friend has to do the thing that is best for the other."
1444,Positive,Great piece of american literature.,I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed. In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck). It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm. They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems. Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream. All around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it.
1445,Positive,Review for Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice an Men is a great novel. It sends you back in time to the Great Depression era of the 1930's. It is a good book for middle school students. The reason I gave this book four stars is because of the profane languange used in the book. Except for the language, this book is a great book to read."
1446,Positive,Astonishing! A Masterpiece! Bravo!,"By far, one of the best books ever written. I felt as if I was in the book taking part of the adventure. John Steinbeck has made it clear that he is among the elite writers in the margin between William Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe.The feeling you get is indescribable when you read this book. The story of when George and Lennie will have their own land, and Lennie could finally raise rabbits - just gives you your own sense of liberty.Please, if you are sensitive and/or depressed, be aware. This book is great, but very depressing."
1447,Positive,of mice and men  by: Ruben from Tx,"Of Mice and MenIn this story there are two very good friends, George and Lennie. They are on a journey for a better life. Lennie is mentally ill so George teaches him right from wrong on the way. They are leaving a little town and going to another town in search of a better job. Several of Lennie's habits get then fired from their last job so they hope that they will have better luck in the next one. Lennie makes quite a few mistakes but no matter what George manages to over look them until Lennie makes a very big mistake which leads to a SHOCKING ending."
1448,Negative,don't read this book,"When I started reading the book at school I found it boring. I had to read it for school (if I didn't read it I would had a 1) and almost all the class found it boring. It's funny when Leenie (principal characters who does stupid thing. George say's in one part to the owner of the ranch ""I'm not saying he's bright, he ain't, but he's as strong as a bull."") but the theme doesn't make it a pleasure to read. The book is easy to understand and doesn't have difficult words. The story is about to people, George and Leenie, who are itinerant workers who go to one place to another to find job. They have a dream but it's very difficult for them to make it true because of Leenie's dumbness. When they're working in ranch problems happens because of Leenie. The entire story is about that subject. To finish my review ill tell you not to spend your time reading this book when there are better books (unless you have to read it for school). I could only recommended to Steinbecks fans."
1449,Positive,Of Mice and Men,"My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact, she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as Of Mice and Men."
1450,Positive,Of Mice And Men,The story oif Mice and Men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment. I expected the book to be about mice. I later found out it was really about. This book was about two lowlife farmers who are trying to get their own stake. George is the brighter one who is in charge of the operation. So the book takes place in a rural area in California. I t is a fiction book. It's a rally good book so you should check it out.
1451,Positive,OF Mice and Men,"A classic, as always. In the today world of teaching tolerance and differences, this remains a good one to use in the classroom."
1452,Positive,Wow,"This book is short, but man it packs a touching message. I had to read it for a class and analyze everything about it and it really is a touching story if you put everything together. The ending completely surprised me, and I can see why George decided to do that. It left me crying for both George and Lennie for everything they had been through. I will never forget this book and will continue reading it throughout the years. Lennie may have been dumb but he was still smart in his own special ways."
1453,Positive,awesome!,this book has been great it brings a lot of emotions and it's cool to see different types of people caring for each other and having a real great friendship until the end........
1454,Negative,dont read this book!,"My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring! It seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really, really boring!"
1455,Positive,You must read this book!,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is a great book to read.It is a book about how George, a small quick guy helps Lennie, a big guy, who is not very smart.Through the story George always helps Lennie.This book makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happens.My favorite part about Of Mice and Men is that it has a sad ending.It's not one of those boring story's where it has a happy endind.This book is more unique."
1456,Positive,Winning The Affiliate Game,"Using just a few of the principles found in this book is helping me turn my sites into cash generators instead of just static sites hoping someone will stop by. Thanks Declan for providing information that truly helps the average, everyday person become successful in this awesome frontier called the Internet."
1457,Negative,Lukewarm at Best,"I saw this in a little theatre in Manhattan, hoping for a more polished, Morrissey-rich experience, but this was a pretty sub-par affair- and frankly it's annoying to see a film this poor with even decent distribution. Terrible camerawork and spotty acting over-all. Bad editing and annoying Cali pop-punk soundtrack, only saved by the presence of Quasi. I was really disappointed- when people put such little effort and inspiration into something, and they get support, one less person with a real vision gets heard. It was occasionally worth a laugh, but overall I found myself angry at the Gods for opening up the Pandora's box of indie films without keeping the hacks out. We have enough of those in Hollywood."
1458,Negative,Overrated,"The funniest parts of this book are the ones used to get you to buy it, the rest was lame. I found myself yawning. The only good thing about this book is how small it is, the boredom ends in a couple of hours."
1459,Positive,"Pretty good, but not all new to me","I bought this book when my twins were 9 months old and I wanted some guidance on daytime napping, and a lot of friends had recommended Healthy Sleep Habits... I didn't mean to buy 'Your fussy Baby', since mine are too old for that- so be careful when you buy this package that you get both books. I had already read a lot of books on sleep training, and while there were some really good tips here, I found 'The Contented Little Baby Book' by Gina Ford more direct. Weissbluth allows for more discretion which I think a mother needs, and overall I think this is a very good book to be read in conjunction with other philosophies, and you can adapt what works for your style and babies. A must-read if your baby doesn't sleep very much and you think it is OK that way- it's not!"
1460,Negative,save your money!,"As an avid movie goer, this just about changed me to a non movie goer. The lesson I learned was to pay a little attention before dropping your money into a ""maybe it might be good because Adam Sandler is in it"". movie. Boy was I wrong! This is not even worth renting! Bad,Bad,stupid,poor writing, acting,filming , generally it sucked!"
1461,Positive,Wonderful!! Watch it twice or you are missing out!,"The first time I saw this movie in the theater, I remember liking it but being so sad at the end. Nevertheless, as I love Drew and Adam, I bought it on DVD when it came out. I couldn't believe how much I laughed!! Now that I knew the ending, it wasn't so sad that I missed the rest of the movie. There are so many clever scenes in this movie that I think people forget if they just watch it once. When Drew attacks Rob Schneider with a bat! When Adam jokes with his walrus and penguin! When Adam apologizes to Drew for not being better looking! I can go on and on.This is the movie my husband and I put on when we want to laugh and cuddle on the couch on Friday night. It's perfect!"
1462,Positive,Another must-have-DVD from Sandler,"I do love Adam Sandler and I thought him and Drew made a great pair in ""The Wedding Singer"" so I just had to watch this. I was not disappointed. It is refreshing to watch a movie where both fun things occur as well as there are well-written punch lines.Henry sees Lucy as a challenge being it she has lost her memory and he makes it his everyday job to make her fall for him. Sooner or later he's bound to fall for her too. The real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her remember.It turns out to be a charming, romantic and very touching movie. One of the BEST movies in this genre to come out in 2005!"
1463,Negative,Schizophrenic product,"At the core of the movie is an affecting concept: a man who falls in love with a woman who can't remember him the following morning. So each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again. It's a touching situation and the two co-leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm. However this wasn't enough for the marketing & development people, so they added a ton of crude slap-stick and a lot of stale and offensive sexual ""humor."" This robs the movie of any chance it might have had to touch the viewer's heart, and left me wondering how the movie ever made it out of the cutting room. The earlier movie in which these two co-leads appeared, The Wedding Singer, was fortunate enough not to suffer from these drawbacks. 50 First Dates is a movie worth missing."
1464,Negative,The First Fifty Sandler Movies...,"... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony, the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film. In short, he doesn't act at all; like Yahweh, he just 'is that he is.'Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny. Being a companionate adult, therefore, I sit cross-legged among them and gape at the screen, forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting. Then sometimes I offer to run out for ice cream...."
1465,Positive,alot like life - funny & tragic,"I won't bore you with the plot of the movie as I assume you have an idea what it's about if you've come this far. I found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy. It was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times (just like life). I am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed. It's just a film and it's meant to entertain. It did a great job of that, with the terrific on-screen chemistry of Sandler (although I can't stand him in most other films) and Barrymore."
1466,Positive,Fall in Love for the First Time Everyday!,"The idea behind this film is that in a successful relationship you have to fall in love over and over again. In this story it happens literally everyday.The performances:Adam Sandler as Henry Roth shows his vulnerable side in his best and most natural performance.Drew Barrymore as Lucy Whitmore has never been better, and has great chemistry with Adam. She emerges as a fine actor.Rob Schneider as Ula may fool you that he is really the character he is playing, I didn't know it was him for half the move! He is brilliantly funny.Sean Astin as Doug Whitmore (better known as Sam from the Lord of the Rings) is funny in this comic role as Lucy's lisping brother.Pomaika'i Brown as Nick (tattoo face) the cook, is great in his small role and deserves bigger roles in the future.Shot in Hawaii, it has beautiful cinematography and vibrant color. The movie is a combination of humor and romance with more heart than you might expect."
1467,Negative,perfume,This did not have a fruity smell at all and had to be thrown out because it is definatley not something I would ever wear again.
1468,Negative,"Stay Away From Passport - Large ""PIP"" Logo On Screen","Both Passport DVD's I've had the misfortune of viewing (this one & Plan 9 From Outer Space) have a large ""PIP"" logo on screen for the entire movie which is extremely distracting & unneccesary. For quality, get the Roan edition."
1469,Positive,Cookwear 4 qt. 3 piece,"I really like this cooker. Somewhat different than expected but after using it, I am sold. Nice size."
1470,Positive,so did you read the DNA report?,"it appears that except Indologist everybody else know how to read mtDNA findings. nowhere in the book I could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on Aryan invasion and migration. and after concluding that Indus valley had the evidence of fire place, shiva and shakti seals and so on, she then again go back to the imaginary of how European white Aryan descended to the black Dravidian world of Indus valley. if that is how Westerner try to write history of other cultures, I myself being a westerner feel very sorry for my own people. The bottom line is this: do not try to defend something that is indefensible. please start writing all the facts in details, and tell us cleary: what happened to the Indus valley culture? did it disappear or continued as the Vedic culture?"
1471,Positive,I like it alot - from an non-latin,"I first started listening to Azucar Moreno through a friend in New York a long time ago... This is exciting music, and you don't have to understand Spanish to get into the party feeling of this music... flamenco, latin pop, whatever you want to call it. Every album seems to have one standout pop booty shaker... I think Tequila claims this title, but Besame is cool, and Tu Eres Para Mi is Funky Cool, and Hay Que Matar a la Muerte pops with energy."
1472,Positive,Topper is Tops!,"... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the ""poor man's Betty Grable""--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid, Patsy Kelly (no one could do a double-take better than patsy) and Rochester, as Cosmo Topper's man servant is hysterical. The beautiful camera-work, the women's gowns, the top-notch special effects and the hysterical sight-gags ranks this with the best of Abbott and Costello comedies. A terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when you're feeling down or bored. Best Scene: the playful seal and Rochester."
1473,Negative,No Thanks-But Barbie is Cool!,"I like baby dolls, but not this one. I love Phoebe and Roxxi, so maybe I would get the big baby versions of those, but no other big Bratz babyz. This doll is not soft, so so much for hugging and cuddling it. It's kind of cute, but I would get big baby Phoebe and Roxxi only.As for your FALSE LIES about Barbie, people are still buying them, Mattel HAS NOT given up, and Barbie will still be aroundfor years to come! I love both Barbie and Bratz and nothing willchange that!"
1474,Positive,Vanessa's Harmonium: A Work Of Art,"Vanessa Carlton's release of her second album shows how talented she really is. Her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is: original and breath taking.""White House"", ""Who's To Say"", ""Afterglow"", ""Private Radio"", ""Half A Week Before The Winter"", and ""She Floats"" stand out from the rest of the album. Each one reveals Vanessa's look on life from the past, present, and future. They also show how she see the world and what she wishes it could be.The rest of Harmonium contain tracks that are amazing as well, for they tell stories which are ear catching. This album is not what I expected it to be after hearing her debut one; Harmonium is a work of art."
1475,Positive,Amazing CD!!!,"This is by far a better CD than Vanessa's first. All I have to say is that this is one of the best albums that I have ever listened to. ""Whos to Say"" has become one of my favorite songs. ""San Francisco"" is also an amazing song. Vanessa really shows what a great artist she is in this album."
1476,Positive,Harmonium: The Second Coming of Vanessa Carlton,"Harmonium is such an incredible record, and it completely exceeds my initial expectations for Vanessa Carlton's sophomore album. It is a little different from 2002's Be Not Nobody in the sense that we are allowed to take a deeper look into Vanessa's beautiful, and sometimes dark, soul. I would have to say that most of the treasures on this record are the more upbeat songs. Some of these songs that steal the show are the bittersweet White Houses, a summer song about friendship, love, and loss, and Who's to Say, a song about choosing between family and a relationhip. Also, though a little dark, Annie shines on Harmonium. If you are not already a Nessaholic, you will be once you hear this talented ivory tickler show off her gift. Harmonium is in stores now, so go out and pick it up now!"
1477,Positive,So much fun and versatile,"My daughter uses the headband as a toy and as a hair piece, a must for any Naruto fan to add to their collection!"
1478,Positive,perfect,fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit
1479,Negative,BAD!! Don't buy IT,This item doesn't even look like the one the picture... It's not the real thing and it's a bootleg one..
1480,Positive,A very informative book,"I expected a work on stalking to be very dry and difficult to get through. This book,however, was extremely interesting,informative and easy to read. It is the sort of book that the normal man in the street could read and apply as easily as someone who is more knowledgeable about the subject. A wonderful handbook for anyone having troubles of this nature and a wothwhile read for any safety conscious individual.."
1481,Positive,Plenty of Emotion,"I don't agree that Clay shows no emotion. One needs only to listen to ""The Way"", ""Measure of a Man"", ""Run to Me"" ... or music from the AI season - ""Solitaire"", ""Here, There and Every Where"" to hear plenty of emotion and inflection. Let's not forget ""Silver Bells"" and ""Give a little love this Chrismas"" (forgive me if I got the title wrong). Hopefully some of you have had a chance to listen to some of his demo music with many spiritual songs and one song that brought me to tears ""I Will Be There"". Not only can this artist belt it out - he can also whisper softly and pull you right into the song. But I digress, as for my review of this CD, the problem is not the singer or the voice of the singer, but the weakness of the songs and their production. Hopefully, they will take more time with Clay's next CD and bring music to the table that matches his talent. I recommend the CD on the strength of Clay's voice and the way it makes you feel even the weaker songs."
1482,Positive,Awesome,Listened to the CD three times and love it. Catchy tunes I caught myself humming throughout the day. Love ballads that I so moving. Great mix of songs. It sure beats listening to some of the hard core music we have on the radio today. A few tunes were almost Beatles sounding. Clean and refreshing!!! Clay should just stay the way he is and his style should be left untarnished by the whoever tries to change it. Anyone who wants an enjoyble CD that they can understand and feel good while listening to it should buy this CD. The CD just makes you feel good. Clay sounds great.
1483,Positive,Hot! Hot! Hot!! This Man Is a Superstar In the Making!,"I cannot describe the wonderful voice of this young man. Its so awesome, he takes my breath away. I recommend this cd to everyone. He shows such emotion and love with each note he sings. Thank you Clay Aiken for this magnificent cd and I so look forward to your tour and your next cd."
1484,Negative,Why won't amazon post my review,"I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's ""Measure of a Man"" does not measure up to Reuben's ""Soulful""."
1485,Negative,Yawn.....,"Don't get me wrong. Clay can really sing. His voice is good enough, but his music is just so corny and boring. All ballads and wanna be broadway sounding songs. I can't even bear to listen. I only do it to figure out what all the furor is about. I still haven't. Save yourself the effort."
1486,Negative,schmalz,"In the new edition of webster's they should stick a photo of this to define ""schmalz"". Oh my god, is this what our music culture has devolved to?. This album was inflicted on me as I was in Border's the other day. I left without buying anything, which is unusual for me. By the way, cats are wonderful creatures."
1487,Positive,If you love Clay aiken you will Love this CD,Out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that Ididn't thing were appropriate for his voice. some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes. Very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately. Hopefully his next album will be just as good.
1488,Negative,Talent without good songs.,"It is obvious that Clay Aiken has talent- there is no fooling about that. He is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now. However, the people producing this album did a poor job showcasing the talent that Clay Aiken holds. Every song on this album sounds the same. The emotions portrayed by Clay are not very diverse; every emotion fits into either the category of ""I am singing about pain"" or ""We are going to get through the pain"". The truth is that this album is painful enough to actually sit and listen to. The only song on this less-than-quality debut that is worth listening to is the title track, ""Measure Of A Man."" This song is in a realm of its own, actually having a worthwhile message.In summation, the talent is there, the album is not. Maybe next time, Clay."
1489,Negative,california,"I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good, a thousnad times, and they will buy anything. It is an admirable thing to see Clive Davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume. A good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this CD:* CDs from The American Idol Series* Closer ~ Josh Groban* The Movie Album ~ Barbra Streisand* Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook ~ Bette Midler* One Heart ~ Celine Dion* The Very Best Of Cher ~ Cher* Buddy Jewell ~ Buddy Jewell* Michael Buble [ENHANCED] ~ Michael BubleIf lack of taste were a crime, all involved with this release would be in jail."
1490,Positive,He is the Measure of a man.,"I love this man...and please don't get me started on his voice!I now can't ever imagine my life without having Clay Aiken in it! He's such a wonderful talent...not only with his beautiful, haunting vibrato, but his whole persona.He is the next Elvis, I can't wait to hear many more albums to come! Believe me I'm a picky person when it comes to music I chose...and I chose Clay!Measure of a man gets an A++++, thumbs up and a million stars."
1491,Positive,good but could be great,"First, I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken. He has a magnificent voice that I feel the ""powers that be"" tried to turn into just another pop singer. I'm not saying the songs are bad, I'm just saying some of them weren't easily recognized as Clay's voice. I would have loved more ballads with the backgrounds a little quieter so Clay could shine through. Let's hope the next album has more of Clay, less pop attitude."
1492,Negative,Measure of a Man's bad Material,"Don't get me wrong, Clay is a wonderful vocalist. Really, truely, he is a gifted singer. But the big problem these days is that there are so many gifted singers who end up with horrible, stale, and downright creepy material. Has anyone actually listened to the lyrics to ""Invisible""? It sounds more like a stalker than a lonely everyman, and it's way creepy. His other songs all sound the same, and in some cases are laughably silly. I feel so let down. I wanted so much to love this album, because I love Clay, but it's just bad. Hopefully next time around Clay gets himself more worthy material, because if he continues down this path, he will end up forgotten. Please! Better material!"
1493,Negative,marketing machine-wolf wearing sheep skin,"Ok people. I like POP music, I do. I like good produced pop music even if artist is commercial. This CD is no different than Pink or Britney CD's as Mr. Clay is claiming to be, different that is. He said people are tired of fake pop stars. Well to tell you the truth, he is no different. It is marketing machine that is trying to tell people how he is so like you, ordinary and all nice, so you could buy his CD. Well that don't matter too much to me if the music is good, but this CD ain't nothing special. Ordinary power ballads with cheap lyrics. I also have message for Clay: Kid, good job with stories about how you're so different than Justin and Pink. American public eats them for lunch, and please now that you have money get someone else to write you album because this one sucks!!!"
1494,Negative,"Great voice, lousy material","This album is a MAJOR disappointment because Clay Aiken has so much promise as an entertainer. His charisma and talent, so evident on American Idol, are noticeably missing on this album of mediocre songs. The title alone was a bad choice - Kevin Sharp also released a ""Measure of a Man"" in the 90s (and was much more deserving to use it, since he was battling cancer at the time of its recording) and this collection of forgettable tracks won't give Clay the staying power he will need to stay afloat in the cutthroat entertainment world. Please, American Idol - you got them through the door, but that means nothing if they can't stay there. Bad album from a bright talent."
1495,Negative,"Great Singer, Wrong Material","The Clive Davis churned out anothere same ol', same ol'...like what David Foster did to Josh Groban....great voices with little to do. The singer can be great but if the material is mostly wrong...oh, well....I will hope for better next time!"
1496,Positive,Changed my life,These recordings deeply affected me- even more so than the works of the Johnny Mathis.
1497,Positive,"5 stars for the voice, 3 for the songs","I would expect no less than great singing, and Clay doesn't disappoint. His voice is just gorgeous. His singing, delivery and the CD's production are all terrific.My one complaint has more to do with music today than with Clay: Can't anyone write a good, up-tempo melody these days?? Some of these songs are just boring. But then again, I find that to be the case with most of what's on the radio nowadays. (Everything is either slow and boring or fast and insipid.) My favorite Clay moments from American Idol were when he sang faster songs - Billy Joel, Grease, Buttercup - so I know he can definitely sing uptempo songs. I just hope he does on the next album!"
1498,Positive,CLAY FAN,CLAY AIKENS NEW CD IS WONDERFUL BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECITED HIS VOICE LIFT'S MY SPIRIT'S UP I AM A DIE HEART ELVIS FAN JUST WATING FOR SOME ONE TO LIKE AS MUCH I THINK I HAVE FOUND HIM
1499,Positive,I Love It.,"When I first listened to ""The Way"" I loved it instantly. It's the kind of song you can sing along with hearing it for the first time. It is very catchy and very romantic. I think this should be his next single. Their will be some that don't like it because its not edgy enough. Who cares. I'm sick of the negative reviews. If they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from. Sorry, for going off there. Anyway, I love ""The Way"" and I also really really like ""Touch"". Overall, I love the entire CD. I am going to play it until I memorize every word."
1500,Negative,I'm sorry,"I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on Clay's CD. I'm amazed that Clay even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was ""cute"". Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name. In conclusion, the only reason I give this CD one star is because you can't give a CD zero stars, if I could give it zero stars I would."
1501,Negative,Crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony.....,"Ugh! From the fake smile on his CD single to the Barry Manilow-ish album cover, this guy screams superficiality! Sorry, Clay....you might have been second in American Idol II...but you are NOT Barry Manilow! I just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their god-given talents and merits to get to superstardom. It smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public. So many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this. Please, spend your money wisely and don't buy this CD. Go out and get yourself ULTIMATE BARRY MANILOW or even a good Celine Dion disc instead. At least those folks worked for years to get where they are...and obviously have some talent. Clay, I wish you luck...but I am sure your career will be history in about a year."
1502,Positive,Measure Of A Man CD Is The Best,"Don't listen to that negative, uncalled-for review by F.Faulkner ""F.F."" He doesn't know what he is talking about. He just came to stir up trouble because he is jealous, rude, and ignorant. Let me clean up this board. Clay Aiken's voice is outstanding and is like no other. ""Measure Of A Man"" CD is exciting and is the best debut CD by a male musical artist in the past 3 years. Clay Aiken is ""America's Idol"" because of his irresistable voice and character and his many, many fans. Please buy this CD. You will not be disappointed at all. The songs are very good."
1503,Positive,The Real American Idol,"This is the real American Idol! Clay's fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks. A must have for all American Idol fans, but this CD is appealing to everyone! 90% of these songs are great. I wish Solitaire would have been included, but it will be on his next single. Finally, a singer with TALENT!"
1504,Positive,Superb!,"Clay Aiken's debut... I wasn't sure what to think, I tried to stay away from American Idol records but when I heard ""Invisible"" on the radio, my resolve melted and I purchased the cd... and I'm very glad I did :).Clay has a beautiful/powerful voice... unlike some artists out there, he's truly talented. He puts his heart and soul into each and every song... There isn't one song on this that I hate.Once he draws you in, you won't let go :).No offense to Ruben fans, but I believe Clay should've won the contest.I couldn't recommend this CD any higher, I believe Clay will be around for a long time to come :)."
1505,Positive,CLAY FAN FROM MIAMI,THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM.
1506,Negative,Clay is Invisible on this CD!!!,"Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stopping numbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in a Westend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
1507,Positive,YAY,"I fell in love with Clay's voice when he sang Open Arms on American Idol. It was so touching, and I never understood whynone of my friends liked him (they liked ruben instead). Nobody thought Clay would ever make it far, and look at him now. He has the BEST VOICE and his CD is AWESOME! I highly reccomend the songs Invisible, The Way, When You Say You Love Me, and This is the night. I especially like When You Say You Love Me because Clay is not as good at uptempo songs, but he nailed this one. I program my CD player to play this song over and over. All of the songs on this CD are awesome and I know you'll love it."
1508,Positive,EXCELLENT!!!!!! 5 stars plus!!!!,"Excellent voice, excellent lyrics, excellent music... This cd has is all. Every track on this cd shows Clay Aiken's pure and natural talent. This cd has not been out of my cd player since its release date, Oct 14, I listen to it everyday. Finally with all the gimmacks that other pop artists try to pass off as talent, there is a young man that has talent, a gift to us all, a truly beautiful voice. Clay fills the void of what is missing in today's music, A REAL SINGER, and he does it so well.Its a shame that I could only give it 5 stars because its so much better than that. Clay is a keeper with the talent to be around for a long time."
1509,Positive,Well Done,"I haven't liked much recent American pop, but Clay sure is a good singer. I watched him perform ""Invisible"" on the Billboard Awards... I was completely blown away. Simply amazing. A friend had also sent me his This is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water single earlier this year. Amazing as well. Good work, Clay. Hope your future albums are excellent as well."
1510,Positive,amazing!,"Clay Aiken does it again!! From the first time I heard Clay sing, I was a fan. I voted for him when he was on American Idol (a lot more then once, let me tell you) and now I am even obsessed with him. I was so excited when Clay's album came out. I love each song on the album and listen to every one evey day almost. There have been a lot of bad reviews and I am not going to get mad because that is their own oppinion. But, I really don't know what they are talking about. Maybe they are listening to a different CD or something, because this album is amazing. His voice could have been showed off more, but on a couple of songs it really is showed off like in Perfect Day. I think a lot of people would love this CD!"
1511,Negative,nothing out of the ordinary,"This man really does have a great voice, don't get me wrong... but I don't think this is an album that people should waste there money on.Yes, I am a fan of Josh Groban but this is not what the deal is about. I just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics. I mean 'Invisible' is about Clay wanting to watch me in my room. That kind of freaks me out. I don't want some guy on my wall watching me ge undressed.Clay got on American Idol to become the famous person that he is. If it wasn't for that show then he would still be a nobody teacher. He has a normal voice. Nothing that someone in a church choir doesn't have.I think that if you are going to blow your money on real music, then you should buy Josh Groban. Yea, he does sing in different languages, but if you translate them they have great meanings. And you can even get addicted to Italian. At least Josh can speak another language. heh."
1512,Negative,When a good voice meets bad music,"This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators, I would be forced to take the stairs. I hope by the next release Clay has the music to complement his voice."
1513,Positive,Listen to it again!,"Being a 31-year old male, I am probably not the typical Clay Aiken fan. As with many, the first time I heard the album I was disappointed...very disappointed. After I listened to it a couple more times it started to grow on me. Now, I think its actually very well done, and Clay's vocals on the album are absolutely incredible.For those who were unimpressed with the album, I encourage you to listen to it again...maybe even twice. If you still don't like it, fine - shelf it...but I think you'll find it will grow on you.It seems a lot of people had a similar experience....the more they listened, the more they liked it. I have also noticed that reviews written within the first few days after the release have been much more negative than those written a week or two later.So....listen to it again!"
1514,Negative,It hurts,It hurts to see Clay fall like this. The momentum leading up to the CD release was so great that it only leads to disappointment. It's not Clay's fault. I blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that Clay could not do anything but fail.Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Josh Grobin's CD is much more satisfying.
1515,Positive,Eventually Measures Up ...,"While I wanted to LOVE this CD - I think Clay is the greatest example of the American ""Can Do"" philosophy, and a decent human being to boot - I was disappointed when I first listened. Other than ""This is the Night,"" the only track to wow me was ""I Survived You."" But, since I wanted to love it, and I had paid good money for the thing, I kept listening ... Then I fell - and I mean HARD! ... I DO love this CD ... No, it is not the greatest musical production ever (in fact, I think it is OVERproduced ... Clay's voice sings for itself - it needs less help, not more); but it is a fine start to a career that will cross many medias - (I would love to see Aiken on Broadway, Mr. Cowell!) and we will watch with wonder at the good this great man will do with his life and his time of fame. He is a performer worth supporting and encouraging ... You go Clay!"
1516,Positive,Fresh Sound,"Clay has made many of us get back into the album buying mode! I think this new release is great in every aspect. I too would like to see Neil Sedaka produce him! That aside, the critics who tell us we can't like him are pushing us right into his ""arms""."
1517,Negative,Not a five star rating,I am very surprised at the 5 starspeople are giving this CD. Pleasedon't waste your money. Clay wasokay on AI2 but this new CD justshowcase his talents. Hopefullynext one will be better. I will haveto give this one two thumbs down!
1518,Negative,Disappointed but still a fan.,"Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD."
1519,Negative,Really bad :(,That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing.
1520,Negative,Doesn't Measure Up!,"This CD is a huge disappointment. Clay has such an awesome voice, and this CD does little to show off his true talent. The songs are average at best and lack the kind of melodies that would truly show off Clay's gift. I've read many reviews of this CD and the most recent stated the same. It lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old CD's. Good luck next time Clay on producing some more appropriate music for your awesome voice."
1521,Negative,Nice guy and great voice,but I liked him better on American Idol. I'm glad that others like it his cd and that he's doing really well on the charts.
1522,Negative,Not What I Expected!!,"I waited in anticipation for the release of this album. I think it's awful with the exception of two tracks - ""Measure of A Man"" and ""This is the Night"". The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time. It sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music. The wonderful voice we heard on ""American Idol"" is certainly not evident on this CD. The lack of ballads is disappointing - he's certainly not cut out to be the next rock star - please don't try to portray him as such."
1523,Positive,CLAY AIKEN IS THE BEST,"I fell in love with him when he first auditioned on American Idol 2. I was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to Ruben. But his sales prove that he should have been the American Idol. I bought his CD the second day it came out, I had been waiting for it for so long and I was not disappointed at all. He sounds wonderful and it feels as if he's singing only to you. If you have a good ear and know good music when you hear it, this CD is for you!! There aren't many good singers left so I'm thankful he's blessed with this gift."
1524,Negative,Why I Hate Potato Chips,"Actually I love Potato Chips...this just plain SUCKS. What is wrong with you people?! Must you follow and do everything a ""reality"" show tells you to do? And this guy supposeldy freakin' LOST! There's something wrong here folks. When society is reduced this low and forget such classics and Beethoven and Mozart Concertos, Classic rock like Floyd or Zepplin, even modern music like Dream Theater and Nightwish...there is something wrong with American Society.Just like with Potato Chips...you don't know when the frell to stop!"
1525,Positive,Decent Tunes.,"I'm not really into pop music. I really like rap and R&B, but I can really dig a great voice. So what can I say? Clay Aiken got a real good voice, soul, power, and range. The songs are a bit predictable and not very challenging, but the dude Aiken racks up all the songs. Touch is a good song, proving that Aiken should explore hip hop a little. When You Say You Love Me has a country sound to it. I DO NOT LIKE country music. I didn't like this song either, but it got itself on in my head for hours. I did like Invincible. Clay can really shake it up. He displays his impressive range in Run To Me and Measure of Man. Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs have a rock edge. The Way and Shine and Run To Me are soulful ballads. I liked Aiken's voice better than the songs. Hopefully, he picks some better song writers next time."
1526,Positive,Clay is da bomb,This CD showcases Clay's talent beautifully!!! He sounds fantastic. I think his music will appeal to a wide range of people. I am very PROUD of Clay Aiken. He has stayed true to himself. Thats refreshing. Way to go Clay!!!
1527,Positive,Amazing,"This is an AMAZING CD! This mans voice is incredable. There is not one song that I dislike. I loved his performances on American Idol, but this CD shows more of what he can do. All you Clay fans are in for something GREAT! Can't say much more, buy it and see for yourself."
1528,Positive,It Is All About The Voice!!!!!,"Clay Aiken's voice stands out more than any other singer I have listened to. It inspires, makes you feel good, excites and is just nice to listen to. I can put his 'Measure Of A Man' CD and listen to EVERY song again, again. Very rare for albums now a days, to have every song enjoyable.1. Invisible - Up tempo pop; catchy and very enjoyable.2. I Will Carry You - Emotional, make you feel good ballad.3. The Way - Again, emotional, make you feel good ballad.4. When You Say You Love Me - Easy listening, country ballad.5. No More Sad Songs - Good ballad, great main chorus.6. Run To Me - Strong ballad.7. Shine - nice listening ballad, Clay sounds very caring.8. I Survived You - Strong ballad.9. This Is The Night - His trademark, awesome ballad.10. Perfect Day - Up tempo ballad, very good.11. Measure Of A Man - Powerful ballad, very emotional.12. Touch - Up tempo, very good.A must have CD. I cannot wait until his next CD."
1529,Positive,Measure Of A Man,"I love, love, love this CD very much!!! Clay Aiken's vocals are perfect and sings so well! Clay Aiken deserves a whole lot more radio airplay."
1530,Positive,skydivergirl,"LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! I have listened to this CD since it came out on 10/14/03---CLAY AIKEN has a magical voice that pulls you in. All the songs are good and the outstanding songs in my opinion are ""The Way"", ""Touch"" and ""When You Say You Love ME""....It is refreshing for an entertainer to have the morals and committments that Clay Aiken has!! I find myself singing along to the music--not that you want to hear me singing. God Bless Mr. Aiken in his future endeavors!! I for one have been thrilled with the music and will continue buying anything Mr. Aiken's releases. Go CLAY!!!!! Don't let the nasties get you down...there are a lot of fans that just want to hear you sing!!!!!!"
1531,Positive,CLAY YOU HAVE AN AMAZING GIFT...I LOVED YOUR ALBUM !!!,"I am extremely proud of you, Clay...Your album is everything I expected and more !!! I was very impressed with your songs and ""always"" with your amazing and beautiful voice. God has truly blessed you with a gift and a beautiful soul !!! I am proud to shout to the world ""I am a Clay Aiken's Fan...and he is my American Idol"". Keep up your good work, in all that you do.You are an AMAZING person. I look forward to ALL of your albums."
1532,Negative,Doesn't do it.,"I've honestly heard this entire album, I'm glad that I didn't buy it. Everything sounds almost the same and I find myself getting bored with his voice. I'm a big fan of everyone on AI, so I listen to every song first before I judge. I would say Kelly Clarkson and Ruben Studdard's CD's are better than this. Please, do yourself a favor and buy those instead, not this. I would recommend maybe downloading some of Clay's songs, but don't spend your money."
1533,Negative,Yawner,"My thrifty (stingy) friend who'd not even throw away month-old newspapers gave me this CD, and told me I could keep it. I should have been suspicious of this unexpected generosity...My hunch was right on... Every song sounds the same, stale, corny and sleep-inducing. I'd rather re-read month-old newspapers-unless I have trouble sleeping, then I'll whip out the CD and I know I'll fall asleep within 2 songs, or faster."
1534,Positive,Clay Shines,"I wasn't sure how I would react to this CD. It's not the usual style of music I listen to, but I love Clay Aiken's voice. I was pleasantly surprised. This CD rocks! My favorite song is Shine. I can't get it out of my head. I also love Measure of A Man and I Survived You. Yay Clay!"
1535,Positive,Let the Revolution Begin...,"After the massive success of Clay Aiken's first single, ""This is the Night"", the expectations were high for his debut album. Luckily, Aiken does not disappoint. From the catchy, up-tempo single ""Invisible"" to the touching and emotive title track, ""Measure of a Man"", this cd provides a fantastic balance of lyrical depth and impressive vocal range. While some think his powerful voice is better suited for Broadway, this impeccable debut cd proves that Clay has the capability of being a phenomenal recording artist. In an industry full of sell-outs and talentless clones, it's refreshing to experience an artist as gifted and genuine as Clay Aiken."
1536,Positive,One of the best albums ever!,"Since the moment I heard Clay on American Idol 2 I have loved his voice. This album shows just what this youg man can do, he can SING! The songs are powerful and sung to perfection by Clay. Every song is really great, and you will definitely listen to this album over and over. I don't see how anyone could not like it, it's just that good. This is one of the greatest, if not the grestest pop album of all time, Clay made a masterpiece!"
1537,Positive,Excellent CD with catchy songs,"This CD is one of very few that I own that I listen to the entire CD. I enjoy each song on the album, and I find myself constantly singing along. I highly recommend this CD."
1538,Positive,Award winner and very deserving of it,"No wonder this man won an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award, and his single and album went platinum and double platinum! I bought this CD because I liked Invisible, because of Billboard saying it's the best pop CD of 2003, and because I figured he must be good if he won awards. I was so glad I bought it after I heard it! What a great album! It's so nice to hear someone with a great voice singing material that's not filled with the nonsense that is on so many CDs today. This is real music!"
1539,Negative,Not Thrilled,"I watched each week to hear this beautiful voice on American Idol, and waited for this CD to be released.I took it home, played it once and it is now in the stack to be traded in.How disappionting. Maybe I expected too much. I do not like the songs. Sorry."
1540,Negative,This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS!,"Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk? This isnt music. This is contrived and manufactured. I don't watch american idol and i never would because it's a awful t.v show that degenarates everything good about music. The ONLY people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know ZILCH about music, and and middle aged woman who buy this for their kids to TORTURE them!! Way too sappy, way too bland. This is safe music for people afraid to listen to music that takes risks and challenges them intellectually. Clay Aiken should stop covering songs from The Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. He's destroying those classics with his ""broadwayesque"" voice. The Beatles were actual artists who took risks in music and were innovative. Clay is nothing like that. Just another talentless popstar getting his 15 minutes of fame and then will fade away into oblivion. The sooner the better!!!"
1541,Negative,If I could have given this CD a zero...,"I'm not a hard person to please, but this CD makes me want to vomit. If you are looking for 12 songs that sound the same, then this is your CD. If you're looking for something with a little variety, look elsewhere. I am a huge fan of Clay's, but was very disappointed with this CD. If you've heard one of the songs, you've pretty much heard them all."
1542,Negative,Not worth Buying,This style is for broadway. The songs are blend!.. He will not last making those type of songs!
1543,Positive,Clay should have won AI,"Clay Aiken is the reason I enjoyed the second season of AI so much. His voice is so pure and strong. It's almost like listening to an angel sing. It is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs. It doesn't matter what he sings, he does an outstanding job. I bought his album and I have to say I think its the best FIRST album of any american idol thus far. Any song he sings that broadcasts his voice range just awes me. Anybody that doesn't think this young man is talented needs to have their hearing checked. He is Spectacular! In my opinion Clay should have won AI..hands down! Definitely an album worth owning."
1544,Negative,This album is not as good as they make it seem,"Only Claymates like it and his fans are buying his way. Mr. Aiken has a large internet fan base who are purchasing multiples to boost his sales to make the album appear to be great, however, they have to beg radio to play it. Here is a response from a radio station:QUOTE: ""As of right now, we have no plans to add ""Invisible"" to our playlist.Interest in the song is strictly limited to fans of Clay Aiken.People outside the ""Claymate"" realm really aren't that into the song.The video isn't even getting substantial play on MTV or VH-1.You may want to try our sister station.The song has more of an Adult Contemporary feel to it.Good luck!"" END OF QUOTEDon't believe all the five star reviews of this album, if you want true reviews of this album read the 3 to 1 star reviews and you will get a fair assessment of what it really is about. The other reviews are all hype with no substance."
1545,Positive,What a cutie!,"When I think of Clay, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""Awwwwwww..."" He is just so cute! And, for once, he's a cutie who can actually sing(!!!) His voice is tremendous, and his songs showcase his voice well. I was a faithful Idol 2 viewer, and rooted for Clay from Day 1. I am delighted to see how much he has grown as an artist (Ruben who?), and how he has overpowered all of the other Idols in popularity, album sales, and TV appearances.My only complaint is the lack of song variety. There's a point where all of the songs start to sound the same, and the only reason that you keep on listening is because, well, it's Clay!He's my favorite Idol!"
1546,Positive,THE MUSIC IS BACK !!,"People who have appreciated Real Music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the ""Measure of a Man"" CD. The crystal clearness, unspoiled beauty, perfect pitch, and power of Clay Aiken's voice is matched by the feeling he puts into every phrase. I am so impressed with this CD and, as much as I love each song, I'm blown away by ""Perfect Day""."
1547,Positive,Great album,"This is an album that I will listen to again and again. Wonderful songs sung by a great voice. ""Touch"", ""I Will Carry You"" and ""Invisible"" are my faves. Pop music at its best!"
1548,Positive,Awesome-Again!,"Clay, once again suprises me..I have listened to this CD thinking how could he be better--he is! Clay's voice, range, his use of his God given talent is astounding. All the songs are wonderful especially Invisible and Measure of a Man! He gets better and better and I hope he has a long wonderful journey ahead. I would recommend this CD to everyone. What a great addition to every music library."
1549,Negative,Whats going on??,I dont like this music at all maybe its just me and if you like this then you probably really think its just me but all music sounds the same well most bands not all but its just trash that we listen to and then after a few years you never listen to it. I dont know i dont have his cd and I'm not going to get it you can if you want to but I like things that are original
1550,Positive,Measyre of a Man AWESOME congrats CLAY,"This is an awesome album...way to go Clay ...We have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with Clay...Can't wait to see him in Concert, and hear more songs from this amazing young man. He thrills all ages..What an amazing ambassador you have..Clay is also OUR American Idol in CANADA as well..Please come here on your concert tour too"
1551,Positive,Blown Away!,"This is truly the best CD that I have bought in a very long time. I followed Clay Aiken all through AI2, loved the first single, was a little worried about the debut CD! I was so ""blown away"" by the songs, his voice, and the fact that his character comes through every song. What an incredible way to start a career! I am anxiously awating the next CD that he puts out. Thanks Clay, you have shown us that singing is still alive!"
1552,Positive,Sublime Voice; Songs don't always measure up,"Clay's voice soars to new territory on this CD, particularly on songs like ""Touch"" and ""Run to Me"" and ""Invisible"", which could otherwise be categorized as ho-hum pop music, if Clay wasn't singing them. The lyrics are a little corny, but Clay makes them sound sincere. The vocal range of most of these songs is not very great, and thus they don't properly show off Clay's unique tenor to-die-for voice.I wish that the ""experts"" who molded some of these songs would have kept their involvement in the project to a minimum, and left the songs pure, instead of processing them with pop synthesizer sounds. I can hear that on any modern day pop album, and it is not very special. On the other hand, I can only hear Clay's voice on a few CD's. And his true voice is great enough that it shouldn't be crowded by synthesizer warble."
1553,Negative,Big disappointment!!!,"Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while, butif you just got to have it, burn yourself acopy from a Clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand."
1554,Negative,AWESOME!!!,I fell in love with clay the first day he auditioned on AI. He is not only adorable he as a AWESOME voice!! girls are crazy over him!! and this CD is SOO GREAT!!IT'S BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVE CLAY SOO MUCH and if u say that you can't stand him then why are you wasting time reviewing over him??JELOUSY!!! : )Keep it up claymates! he has already gone double platinum!!! WOOWOO!
1555,Negative,clay is such a joke,"he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him, ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clay's an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad."
1556,Positive,Love It!,"I just love this cd. After I got the cd I must have played it over and over for days. There is not a song that isn't great! Everything is sung with such heart! I think Clay Aiken is the best thing to happen to pop music in a long time. No gimmicks, just pure talent!"
1557,Positive,The Best CD I Have Ever Heard,This CD sent chills down my spine. Clay Aiken is a very gifted vocalist.
1558,Negative,Teen Titan Tower falls apart,"This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star, only because zero is not an option. My son really wanted this toy, and when he got it, he played with it for about 5 minutes, and walked away. Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is. It comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car. Nice concept, except the thing doesn't come out all the way, so my son ends up pulling the thing out. There are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions, they don't. The tower keeps falling off of it. All around, I can't believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money. You would think I bought it at the dollar store or something. I would urge all who consider buying this toy, to talk your kid into something else. IT'S TERRIBLE!!!"
1559,Negative,OK Toy,"I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter, who loves teen titans, for Christmas. The instructions, what there is of them, is very hard to decipher. The orange launch thing would not work and I had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out. (the red switch was not in the right position from factory). Even then the orange track does not fold all the way out. Also, like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily. I just don't feel like I am getting what I am paying for these days when it comes to toys."
1560,Positive,Good stuff!,"I take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints. A higher dose helped considerably with the common cold (along with taking Vitamin C and garlic); the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within 2 days as opposed to the usual 5 with garlic/C. I cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me. I rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin, let it sit overnight covered with a bandage, and the spot had shrunk considerably by morning. Is this the placebo effect in action? Perhaps, but I don't see the harm in using it if this is the case. At least it seems to help."
1561,Negative,Not worth it,"Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters, it's all downhill. It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples. It's all theory. Don't waste your money and don't listen to all the fancy quotes on the book's back cover. This book just doesn't cut it."
1562,Negative,Car Parts (struts) for [] Java []...,"This book is a complete waste of time. I had been very skeptical of the technology being only a short-cut for Java web hacks and script-kittys, and I was unfortunately right. Those that can explain how JSP cannot TRUELY conform to the MVC methodology, should really read this book. It would serve them right reading this boring drivel instead of actually learning the core J2EE web framework. Ted Husted should be beaten with this book or an actual car strut.I love most of tools that come out of the Jakarta project but here is a suggestion, learn and know each of the tools suggested for MVC impletementations and skip the gimmic tools, like STRUTS, TURBINE, and VELOCITY. In the event you do buy this book, please consider it's many other uses.I know for me, it has been instrumental for leveling my air conditioner."
1563,Negative,non working battery,The watch is in perfect condition but cannot set the time and it keeps going dead. I thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch. I wont order from this vendow again.
1564,Positive,Don`t listen to the review...,This album jams! Yes it is old school influenced but it is a lot catchy fresh techno-pop JAM!
1565,Negative,"Works fine, but expensive","The filter works fine, and I was about to order another. I paid $5.75 for it 7 months ago, and now it is almost $30. I mean we all expect to pay a little more when we buy items later on, but more than 5 times as much?"
1566,Negative,Special Waste of Time,"This movie is for you if -(a.) you are over 20 and still read comic books(b.) believe that someone would believe that taking a blue pill would make them a superman(c.) then spend their life trying to enact their powers contrary to all reality telling them otherwise(d.) find humor in the situations that people with reduced mental functioning find themselves(e.) and don't know that, unless distorted, the reality of such individuals is too mundane for a movie(f.) and that some cheaply made movies are not made to convey an altruistic message but to make money."
1567,Positive,Hystericly Funny,"Thought this film was very funny, well done. Acting was great, directing was gritty, but worked well for this movie, and it's story.Would highly recommend if you like dark comedies."
1568,Positive,Better than I thought,"I would consider myself a ""radio"" Damn Yankees fan, having only heard their radio hits like, ""Don't Tread on Me,"" and, ""High Enough."" After hearing this Essentials CD though, I see that there's more than meet's the ear. The only song on here that I can't seem to get into is, ""Come Again,"" but all the others are real rockers for me. From the milder, ""Silent is Broken,"" to the fast and heavy, ""Piledriver,"" this CD never stops! The guitars, vocals, bass, and drums, all rock. I tend to give conservative ratings, so that's why I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, but otherwise, I would highly recommend it for any other ""radio"" fans like myself."
1569,Negative,Do not be deceived!,"This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of ""Beowulf"". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the ""Beowulf"" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original ""Beowulf"" with the mythological Viking god ""Odin"". The original ""Beowulf"" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof."
1570,Positive,creative action all over,"this book is almost all actoin about a man who is a very strong and kind warrior. he knows that the goodness inside of him can defeat any evil. he uses that knowlage to kill monsters. The book is a little confusing at times, but everything elese is very creative and understandable. I would sugjest this book to 11 year old and up for the concern of some grusome scense. it is only 94 pages, a good lengh for a bed-side book. by the way-beowulf is the guy on the horse not the monster on the cover :)"
1571,Positive,Chaka's Powerhouse Vocals!,"When this Lp came out in 1982, a Billboard ad stated 'The Most Powerful Instrument in Music Returns'....and it did! This Chaka lp is one of her best and it shows how to use Power Vocals correctly! I think this Lp was ahead of it's time...a Great fusion of R&B;, Funk & Jazz..Arif Mardin KNEW what to do with Khan's voice! 8 powerful examples of why Chaka Khan is one of the Greatest Singers ever!!I have this on vinyl & CD!!! :)"
1572,Negative,Huxley it ain't...,"I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors, but I must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy. The narative reads like a poor translation. Really bad style. A few funny moments... but overall, a very dissapointing book for me considering it's high falutin' reputation. I'll stick with Huxley, if and when I seek enlightenment."
1573,Negative,Through the Madness!!!,"First of all, Ike is doing the very thing that Tina always said he would do. Ike Turner will never admit to what he did to Tina. Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like ""all the others."" Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!"
1574,Positive,works!,"I have been taking these for 6 months- I don't love taking 6 tabs a day, but they seem to work best when you do. The price is better then some of the other products on the market also."
1575,Positive,Even Creepier Than You Thought,"What's most amazing is the tape recording of his final speech to convince all the parents to begin giving their children poison. Only one headstrong black woman speaks up with a speech that ""these babies deserve to live."" Sadly, the interviewer just lets the survivors ramble, when most seem quite willing to answer tough follow up questions. It needed at least another hour."
1576,Positive,BUEN PRODUCTO,"Esta excelente el producto, es tal como lo esperaba.. y bueno por supuesto el servicio de entrega fue inmediato."
1577,Negative,Only useful as a backup to Snell and Weightman,"If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as ""Teach Yourself Hindi"" does. The authors of that title, R.Snell & S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell & Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice."
1578,Positive,Yancey has another one,"I have read all Philip Yancey books & he gives an intellegent & amazing insight of the true religious life demonstrated in the Bible. This provides a person the detailed readings therein, its relationship to everyday life experiences .... all is in proper perspective. It's also an excellent tool for Bible Study. I have it in printed book form & also on my E-Reader.Don't leave home without it."
1579,Positive,The Paradise War book,I was very pleased at how quickly I received my purchase. It was for a gift and I tend to be a procrastinator at getting things.
1580,Negative,Good show but TERRIBLE packaging,"The other reviews cover the show well so I won't go into that, but I do want to warn you that the DVD case is really cheap, with the DVDs doubled up in the same slot. For the sake of 10 cents cost to them, they have produced something that is very likely to scratch your DVDs."
1581,Positive,The Sanctuary,I like this show. But then again I like Sy-fi. Amanda Tapping is a good actress. Enjoyed her in StarGate SG1. And in the show sanctuary she does a great english imitation..
1582,Negative,Sanctuary Season 2.....Fail,"After enjoying the first series of sanctuary I have recently purchased the second season, Looking forward to the continuation of some good story lines I have been incredibly let down. The first season had some 'shoddy' effects but somehow they have deteriorated into something even worse, there is very poor interaction between animations and cast. I could perhaps forgive this if there was something else good about the series, unfortunately they have really destroyed what was a good series, I have watched 4 episodes and am unsure I will watch any more, the acting is poor, the storyline is worse, the new characters are uninspired and I have no motivation to watch any more as its definitely not getting any better. If you enjoyed the first series you are better off leaving it there and not ruining the series by watching this series. You have been warned."
1583,Negative,Temperature displayed is incorrect,"The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor. I returned the thermometer for an exchange from Amazon. The replacement has same problem I did calibrate it, still it shows wrong temperature. I liked ease of mounting on the window and size, but completely useless as fas as what value it shows for the temperature."
1584,Positive,"Olives, Sheep, and Nicotiana","How to write a domestic horror story and gardening book in one. Terror so subtle it could happen to you, olives so ripe you'll be picking in no time:Dirk has a lovely garden. He also likes trees. A lot. There's a guy who gets his legs chopped off by accident, then there's Dirk's conscience. Is he really responsible for so much death? He thinks he is. Coming in with his black cloak and scythe, Monsieur Bogarde lives with his so-called 'agent' who gets colon cancer and alzhimer's (is this Dirk's doing?). They plant things and pick olives and live in France, then they don't plant things and pick their noses and live in England. But death cannot be escaped. Dirk has a stroke, his 'agent' drops dead, and they all live happily ever after. Based on a true story."
1585,Positive,"If you loved the First Outbreak, You'll love this one","Something to always look foward to in a Sequal is the gameplay you loved from the first. That's the Great thing about OUtbreak 2, it has the same controls, but this time you can CHOOSE who you want to play with you. for instance, If David does not work well with Kevin, but works well with Jim, then you can choose Jim as your partner. Plus you can walk as you shoot! The only downside is that theres not going to be a Outbreak file 3 :("
1586,Negative,Boring!!!!!,"The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring. I expected it to be action-packed, boy was I wrong. Every level has like 0-3 zombies. I RENTED THE GAME TO SHOOT ZOMBIES, NOT INFECTED ANIMALS. My advice, try it at a friends house or play a demo first."
1587,Positive,I did it so anyone can...,"I am a grandmother with no woodworking experience. I made the foolish decison to put up large crown moulding in my bedroom and got hopelessly stuck at the inside and outside corners. I looked for help on the net and found this book. Three days later I finished the job and the corners were absolutely perfect! The directions are written and illustrated so that anyone can follow them. I have more trouble making a souffle than I had working with crown moulding - thanks to this book. It should be in everyone do-it-yourselfers library. By the way, I saved a fortune doing this project myself."
1588,Positive,Good Book - Presumably in Either Edition,"My daughter (almost 3) enjoyed this book from the library last Halloween & we're looking forward to reading it again this Halloween. I loved introducing her to Halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors, rather than scary monsters, pranks, or candy. The illustrations were lovely. I'm sure the original edition had beautiful illustrations too, and the previous reviewer might have been chagrinned by the changes to a personal childhood favorite. But I'm guessing that most people who, like my family, discover the story for the the first time in this edition will find nothing amiss."
1589,Negative,The Worst of Kirk Whalum,Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster!! It doesn't deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true Jazz lovers. Please do not judge Whalum by this CD. I'd recommend 'Unconditional' instead.
1590,Negative,worst dress shirts thin cloth and not professional at all,"I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors, Save $8 by not buying this product ...Very thin and very large sized shirts .... they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ..."
1591,Negative,Horrible product,"This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market. The fabric is cheap, so cheap, that I threw the darn thing away"
1592,Positive,Shirt in picture is not what they send you,"First off, the shirts are good. They are thin, but they look good. The collar tips have built-in plastic strips to keep them pointed and crisp. They come out of the dryer pretty good w/o wrinkles if you use the wrinkle-guard cycle. However, the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you. The shirt in this pic above has a much tougher, textured material, and the actual shirt has a white label, not black as in the pic. So, expect a very thin, smooth, untextured but stylish shirt, with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice, but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get."
1593,Positive,Good buy with reservations,"Of course the list price is a joke. However, for the price, the quality is quite good. It uses thin material but is fine for summer. It is about 1/2 size larger than most brands so you might want to go for the smaller sizes. Just remember, this is not your $65 deparment store shirt. And yes, only the blue colors look good."
1594,Negative,"Very thin, Flimsy","If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $3.99 plus $0.99(per item) return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this ""quality""?"
1595,Negative,Poor Quality,"I bought this shirt for one reason, the price, and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap. Because of the cheap materials. Save your money, spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality."
1596,Negative,smack the editors,"As mentioned by other reviewers, this DVD is just horrible to watch because of the absurd amount that the cameras cut away to another scene every few seconds. If you want to watch a guitar solo or anything else for that matter to absorb any details, forget it! The editor(s) didn't do the Scorpions justice. The music is good, but since this is a DVD and not a CD, I'm giving two stars for the spazoid video technique."
1597,Negative,A clas-sick that made me sick,This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers
1598,Negative,Interesting but Repetative,"While reading this book I was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning. But as the book goes on, the main character continues to classify underwater creatures over and over and over. The only thing that kept me reading until the end was the mystery of Captain Nemo (which i have to say, was never really revealed, and a bit disapointing ending). So all together, and VERY detailed and interesting book, but too slow and boring overall."
1599,Positive,Oldie but a goodie,I have seen the movie (needs to be remade wih today special effects come on Disney) and really enjoyed the book.
1600,Negative,A disappointing read for the 21st century,"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read."
1601,Positive,Twenty Thousand Leagues,"A mysterious creature is haunting the seas, and Professor Aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast. However, the encounter brings more than he ever expected, as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world's oceans. The aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul, while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large.Verne's underwater adventure is the latest novel I have read to my toddler at bedtime, and is far from my favorite. As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all."
1602,Negative,Internet connection turns off all the time,"After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then, the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off.No lightning have fallen near my house, nor any other extraordinary event have happened.I have looked for help from zoom, internet forums and my ISP company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem, apparently a common one if you buy an X6 zoom modem/router.The only definite solution: buy a new modem (not a zoom modem)"
1603,Negative,A REAL MESS,SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess.
1604,Positive,Awesome!,"I choose this book because it was economically priced. The book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover, but the inside was totally fine. The description of the book was completely accurate."
1605,Negative,"Yadda, yadda, yadda!","If you took out every comment by cast, writers and producers on trying (unsuccessfully)to figure out Lorne Michaels, this heavy tome would easily be cut in half. Too much whining, too little interesting, historical information for me, a long time fan of the show."
1606,Positive,LOL!,"Good stuff - some funny, some serious, but all the little ""stories"" you've never heard from behind the curtain at SNL!"
1607,Positive,Narnia: Prince Caspian,"It was a great choice between BD and DVD, of course I bought the BD. As you all know the quality is far more better than regular DVD. The movie had a pretty good opening to and it was very catchy. Story has a pretty good plot to it but it wasn't as good as the first movie. there were more action on the first movie compared to this. All in all it was a great and fun movie to watch."
1608,Negative,Thanks for the case,I was disappointed with this seller. I got an empty DVD case that was shrink wrapped. The most frustrating part about it was I never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again. There goes my hard earned cash!
1609,Negative,Very Disappointing,"If you enjoyed the book, you won't want to watch the Disney version of this movie. Characterization was changed (a friendly dwarf became a nasty grump, Prince Caspian and King Peter had jealousy issues); scenes were added that weren't in the book, and basically all of the best parts of the book were omitted. There were battles that never took place. In fact, fighting was the main focus of this movie. Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie. If Disney wanted to create a fantasy battle movie, they should have just hired someone to write one. Prince Caspian is definitely NOT the Prince Caspian that C.S. Lewis wrote. I will definitely not watch any more Disney adaptations of Narnia."
1610,Positive,OMG,"OMG!! This was TERRIFIC! I was so pleased that all the actors/actresses from ""TL, TW, ATW"" came back to Prince Caspian!!! It was awesome... the sword fights, the battles, the waking of the trees, Reepicheep, and the bits of humor mixed in here and there! I loved it!"
1611,Negative,Too Precious,"Too long and too precious. This second Narnia film still finds the children in wartime England waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to Narnia. Hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe, once again evil outsiders are threatening to overwhelm the animals and folk of Narnia's forests. The children eventually save the day and return to the train station after heroic battles and soul searching speechifying. Although technically amazing, the story is drawn out to a sense of boredom and the characters, other than the children, lack a strength and sharpness that made the first film so enjoyable. It isn't a film we'll watch again and again as we have Wardrobe."
1612,Positive,Correction on May 16th Review,"The software mentioned on my May 16th review IS called ""AVID Xpress"" -- not ""AVID Express"" -- when my review was edited someone changed the spelling, possibly thinking it was a typo/mistake?"
1613,Positive,Easy to follow,This is a quick reference or trainer. Use it to help Scouts with their knot requirements. Simple diagrams take the used step by step through each knot.
1614,Positive,"Knot idiots, rejoice!","In no way does this little card set replace books or experience, but for field use for common knots, (especially in a stressful situation) it's priceless. I've already needed it on so many occasions (work and around the yard), that I moved one of them from my BOB to my small EDC pouch. If you're anything like me, ""kind of"" knowing how to tie a specific knot can get you into more trouble than not having tied the darn thing in the first place! I had to secure some items for an typhoon and boy did this thing come in handy. *All* of my ropes and knots stayed tight unlike my usual post-storm assessment of finding them untied and strung out in the yard! Yes, you could probably make a set, but these are nicely printed on credit card like material (albeit a bit thinner) and are really legible and handy. If you have a BOB, this is a MUST have (especially for those you think you need 300' of 550 cord in your BOB).Four stars because I wish you could separate the cards for easier access."
1615,Positive,Very Cool,I ordered this mainly to learn some Knots. This is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip. Use the examples to try out some knots.Good product. Very useful.
1616,Positive,Have not needed it yet,This is pretty cool. It shows you how to tie some basic knots that can Come come in handy in various situations. I got this so I can leave it in my go bag with 100ft of some paracord.
1617,Positive,The Wind in the Willows,"A beautiful book with detailed, descriptive, lovely drawings, this gift to my granddaughter was well received, and she takes it to bed every night."
1618,Positive,inspiring,"a movie needs to be done about this guy. dont listen to al sharpton- if booker t can do what he did, anyone can. i'd give it 5 stars but for the style of writing at the time leaves me wanting coffee"
1619,Positive,The recipes sound great.,I look forward to trying many of the recipes and really appreciate the nutritional information. However the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as 1/8 of recipe. This is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup. The soup would have to be divided into 8 servings to get an accurate calorie count. Even with that drawback I know I will enjoy some of the dishes.
1620,Negative,One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read.,"Factually shaky at many points, pedestrian prose, self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing. What I found most offensive about this book was the author's egotistical disdain for the, ""lesser climbers"", of the team. In fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug, arrogant jerks. Having been on climbing expeditions before, there is a great deal of stress, raw feelings, etc, but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting. Don't even get started on their ugly American ""analysis"" of Asians on Denali.Read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so."
1621,Negative,Laughing Aloud: One Reader's Story of True Hilarity and Boredom-Defying Perusal in the Face of Denali's Silliest Story Ever!,"The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!"
1622,Positive,The bittersweet summit,"A must read for anyone preparing to climb. You will understand that mountainclimbing is not for the flippant, the hurried, the unprepared. This extraordinary story tells of the extreme suffering endured to achieve the summit. You learn about the death zone and about what happens to the body at various altitudes. An excellent adventure story for both men and women."
1623,Negative,I was disappointed,"I also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish. As a redhead, I feel armed with some more knowledge about the history of redheads but was left... hanging, somehow.I found it disjointed and it was not an enjoyable read."
1624,Negative,Was she serious?,"Since I have a red-headed daughter, this sounded lioke a fun book to read. I gave it up just about 1/3 of the way through. Maybe it got better but I wasn't going to stay around to find out. The author really stretched it to make her point. Her point? Maybe becasue she's a redhead, she wanted to be so very, very special, so she took a few supposed facts and made a whole concept from them. Come on! Trying to make redheads all some sort of special witches, monmsters, super-human people was dumb. And she totally dissed red-headed men. My husband read it through but we both quickly decided NOT to send it to our daughter."
1625,Negative,It's okay.....,"I really wanted to love this moisturizer! I have very fair, sensitive skin, and this was supposed to be one of the best bets for my skin type. It also has a great high SPF.But, alas it does not sink into my skin. It does not blend well at all. It leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub in.Maybe because of the high SPF? I am not sure,but I was definitely disappointed."
1626,Positive,"Excellent Series, Poor DVD casing","The series is excellent and faithful to the literary history surrounding the Robin Hood legends. Clannad's music adds a bit of authenticity, as does the use of magic and superstition, and the UK setting.Acorn did a reasonably good job digitizing and adding subtitles to the original film. Colour was on the dark side, but nothing that can't be adjusted.The poor packaging of the 'complete' set prevents me from giving it a perfect score. I like the look and the folding-book concept of it, but the casing is made of hard plastic, making it prone to chipping and difficult to remove the DVDs carefully without breaking or cracking them. I had a similar problem with the ""I Spy - Four-Pack Collection"" cases. So, take care to remove the DVDs lest you damage them permanently. You might consider alternative storage like a plastic CD envelope case, considering this DVD set is not cheap.Aside from this, I highly recommend the complete Robin Hood set."
1627,Positive,Robin of Sherwood,Picture is fuzzy not digitallly remastered. Also Disk 2 had a glitch in it on the first play. Disk is clean. Over all quality is not great.
1628,Negative,Misrepresented Product,"The image shown is EXACTLY what you'll get; it isn't misrepresented on Amazon. The package is mis-leading. It clearly shows a 2.2 mm Hex-nut. It does not work on any glasses that have a hex-nut. In fact, I was about read to toss it out, when I went and took a dental-pick and pick some plastic or parafin out of the tip of it--when I finally got it to work on my CostCo glasses that use a ""star"" driver. It contains a tiny phillips head, tiny flat-head, and the ""star"" driver. No hex-nut. I'm going to have to order something else. Isn't worth my time and frustration to send it back."
1629,Positive,Every kind of comedy styling all in one film...,"What makes this film truly great is how many different styles of comedy it has. You see not only slapstick and situation based comedy, but also some fabulous dialog and scare comedy. I didn't want to watch this movie at first, thinking it'd be a run of the mill b/w film, but was amazed, and immediately rewound and watched it a second time."
1630,Positive,One of the best readings about stats!,"This book is a pure pleasure reading for anyone interested in statistics, but wants to have a break from formulas and software! In fact, I would make it a must read for all citizens who are bombarded by over-complicated news about all areas of our life."
1631,Positive,Outstanding book,"Someone once said ""there are three kinds of liars: liars, damn liars, and statisticians.""I read this book in high school, and it shaped my judgement of the news media, business, and advertising ever since. Never trust the numbers without knowing their basis, and remember: a statistician is the type of guy who would put his head in an oven, and his feet in a bucket of ice, and say that, on average, he felt fine."
1632,Positive,An Entertaining Primer on the Validity of Statistics,"Although ""How to Lie with Statistics"" is a bit dated (having been written in the 1950's), the principles it puts forth are still valid today--if not moreso than ever--and the material is delivered in clear, concise, and even entertaining anecdotes and illustrations.How often do you hear statistics bandied about in the media or used to try to prove some special-interest point? ""Of course"" the people quoting the figures must be right with numbers on their sides... until you look at just how those numbers were arrived at.This book isn't truly a guide on how to lie with statistics, but it is an excellent text that informs the reader both how others will lie to them using statistics and on how to interpret the validity of purported statistical data."
1633,Positive,"Clear, Concise, and Fun","How to Lie with Statistics is a fun and informative look at the was in which statisticians try to decieve the public with misleading statistics. Every chapter contains plenty of real-world examles that provide excellent insight into the concepts. The book is a quick read (only 142 pages) and it holds the reader's attention; both are necessities for an educational work. How to Lie with Statistics is perfect for the beginning statistics student or anyone who wants to learn how they can be decieved through the manipulation of numbers. The reading level and math make this more appropriate for high school or college students than for younger students. Using three randomly selected paragraphs, the mean Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 10.4; thus this book is excellent for sophomores or advanced freshman. Although the writing is a little dated (1954), it is still clear and highly relevant. Overall, this is a highly recommended and worthwhile read."
1634,Positive,An Up To Date Primer!,"This book is a very good primer for getting one's feet wet in the world of non-profit organizations. While it is by no means exhaustive, it is certainly broad and deep enough for anyone to run their non-profit more efficiently and more ethically. It covers excellent project, team and board building strategies, as well as nearly every type of fundraising and solicitation. Additionally, there is good information on employing the internet for communication, engagement and fundraising -- STILL a fairly new field for many.Appendices A-C cover some very good tools and examples. Though the listed government grant sources in appendix D focus mainly upon the Humanities and the Arts, valuable web sources are given for finding grants in other areas."
1635,Negative,sony printer,not really what i wanted xxxxv xxxxx xxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxx x xxxxx xxxx zzzz zzzz zzzz
1636,Negative,A waste of money -- and tin.,"This collection amounts to three dollar-store discs jammed into a pretty package. For those who prefer substance over style, look elsewhere for this material, which is given a pretty shoddy presentation overall.Disc 3 (which was unplayable on the two DVD players I tried it on) repeats the entire contents of Disc 2, and adds the TV pilots Kook's Tour and Jerks Of All Trades -- making Disc 2 a pointless redundancy. Avoid it at all costs."
1637,Negative,Misleading,"You get what you pay for with this set. Only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun. It may fill the gap in someones collection, but mostly contains fillers and short dvds. It appears to be a collection of videos that no one else wanted. One full DVD is the lame three stooges cartoons. If you are looking for classic stooge comedy this set contains very little."
1638,Negative,Not what I expected - a rip off,"The price was attractive, as was the packaging. The box shows Curly. But alas - Curly is not easily found in this compilation. Also - a lot of the ""extra features"" are lame. Stay away from this product. If you really want the Three Stooges - buy the 8 volume compilation from Sony instead."
1639,Negative,Total rip off,"The Three stooges( Collectors Edition)The box says ""7DVDs over 11 hours"" what they dont say is that there are only 4 classic stooges shorts and only on the first DVD. The rest of the set is crap. The reamaining 6 1/2 dvds /10 hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons ( remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the 60's) It is intentionaly misrepresented. The packaging is first class, a real eyegrabber, but whats inside is junk."
1640,Positive,Good Read,i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it. I enjoyed it but will not read it again.
1641,Positive,Quite possibly the scariest novel ever constructed,Go to a used bookstore. Search the internet. Scour the newsgroups. And find this book. I have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late Tryon does here. His mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists. Simply a sensational piece of work -- and a travesty that it's out of print.
1642,Positive,chico hamilton timely,cheeks grove is the hook on this cd . chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band....worth a listen BIG DADDY
1643,Positive,I hate reductionists,"As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish. But, as an incissive criticism of reductionist science, especially biology, it is very good."
1644,Positive,skillful,"Reading this is reading a master at work. Pinsky wields so much skill it's ridiculous. Reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent, old man sitting in a chair somewhere in a field, giving his thoughts free rein, following them where they land. In my opinion, the poem ""The Figured Wheel"" is a lyrical, breath-taking masterpiece."
1645,Negative,we must feel bad that this was our Poet Laureate,"Pinsky is in love with being a poet, but his poems don't mean anything to the rest of us. This book is a perfect example of this. We are supposed to admire him, not read him, and I find it a shame that this lousy work got him a Luareateship."
1646,Positive,Great!,"I like em a lot, wife thinks they're the best cereal she's ever had, teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food, the others here like them enough. Bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that I'll buy again, just too good (and a unique flavor...really like the pumpkin seeds in them) not to."
1647,Positive,Great Resource for Victorious Living,"This is a great resource for victorious living! It shows the consequences of choices each of us make in our lives and how important it is to make the right choice to live a life of true freedom and liberty! It is a quick read - I was fascinated with the stories shared from the beginning and had a hard time putting the book down! I got copies for my family to help encourage them as they are getting ready to enter the ""dating"" stage of their lives to help them stay on course and help give them the tools to save themselves for marriage as God intended. I highly recommend this book - whether you're married or single!!"
1648,Negative,"Fine Film, Abysmal DVD","This is a fine Randolph Scott film. Unfortunately the DVD has interference on the audio channel (bass-heavy contemporary music, as if someone was playing something through the board when the transfer was made) and the print itself shows damage in places. I have never encountered a major studio release with this level of audio interference. Thanks for caring, Columbia Pictures!"
1649,Positive,Very nice,Item was just as described. Very nice fit...does not slip down your leg and also securely holds your weapon. I would definitely buy this again. Perfect
1650,Positive,"terrifically written, great story.","Ruarke is rightfully called the master of outdoor writing. This is a fabulously written story of his first safari in Kenya and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). It is a must read for anyone who enjoys outdoor literature, hunting stories, or Africa."
1651,Positive,Great,"This eight pound bag lasts our cockatoo 2-3 months. Way more economical to buy here on Amazon than in the store. We reseal it for storage, and use it well before it goes stale (colours and smells still vibrant)."
1652,Negative,choco tacos,"I have to say I haven't actually read this book, but I feel like if you are considering giving this author a chance to influence your eternal salvation, you ought to give the nice people who come knocking at your door a chance too. Then pray about what you have learned and decide for yourself. But if you want to celebrate over Choco Tacos, you would have to go to Taco Johns, I used to work there and they are the ones who sell the tasty treat. (see other reviews for this book to understand what I am talking about!)"
1653,Negative,"As a How-To Book, this one just doesn't work.","It's the truth that early Mormon leaders told fanciful tales about Moon Men and the Lost Ten Tribes . . . to their kids at bedtime. It seems there's a difference between what a Mormon leader says from the puplit as official doctrine, and what they say having fun with their family. It's the same with anyone. This book takes snippets from private journals and attempts to pass them off as official doctrine. As a How-To Book, this one just doesn't work.A better book to buy from Amazon on this subject is Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass : The Art of Telling Tales About Joseph Smith and Brigham Young (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 11) . Hugh Nibley, David J. Whittaker (Editor) / Hardcover / Published 1991"
1654,Negative,Horribly Disappointed!,"Don't get me wrong, ""Harriet the Spy,"" was one of my all time favorite books (and movies), growing up. I'm almost 26 now and had always wanted to read ""The Long Secret,"" So after re-reading Harriet, I went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy. Well, at first it wasn't so bad, but there really wasn't any real point to the story. Harriet hadn't matured much at all, and to make matters worse, really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place. I am also a Christian and find it offensive that the phrase ""Jesus Hates You,"" should be allowed to be published in a Children's book. This is especially true in this day and age, when almost any threat has the potential to turn violent.Skip this one."
1655,Negative,the long secret--,just didn't like this book. it seem to be crude and it's really a book for girls only.
1656,Positive,Good for Smaller bows,This product is light in weight and good for smaller non parralel limb bows. I have a Mathews Reezen and it was too small. Amazon has a great return policy and traded for Plano Max XT.
1657,Positive,Presents a way of devotion to Jesus and Mary,"This book presents a marian version of the traditional Greek orthodox Jesus prayer. Instead of ""Lord Jesus Christ, son of the living God, have mercy on me a sinner"", Sister reveals that Jesus has told her to constantly repeat the phrase ""Jesus, Mary, I love you. Save souls."" While on the surface the prayer is very simple, it is difficult in practice because of the requirements of purity of mind, intense desire, and continuous repetition. Sister says that Jesus finds the prayer most pleasing, of great benefit to all souls, living and deceased, and with the help of grace, can be done by anyone. This is a method of prayer for the ""littlest ones"" of all ages."
1658,Negative,YUCK!,"I returned this product. The legs were too big and the waist too small. I looked like I was in a strait jacket. I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it, other than the rubber smell I can't elimate, but this product sucks!"
1659,Positive,A very REAL book,"Leaving the issues for apostates and apologists to bicker over, this book simply looks at the lives of people actually in the church: what they do in their normal every day lives. I especially liked the depictions of Latter-Day Saints in nations outside the United States, including the temple trip down the Amazon and a few shots of Victoria Peak! Beliver or no, these pictures tell 10,000 words about a people that are industrious, optimistic, and compassionate. These photos aver that while many continue to criticize and ostracize this church, the Latter-Day Saints frequently hold the moral/ethical highground on their idealogical opponents. How many other 200-year old American religions would stand under this kind of across-the-globe scrutiny? This book contains real, in your face, irrefutable evidence that like them nor not, the Mormons are indeed a ""peculiar people."""
1660,Positive,Summer of my german solider review,I enjoyed this book a great deal. The story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing. I thought that many issues in the book were easy for students to relate to even today. The author didn't pull any punches in this startling work. I enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up.
1661,Negative,BORING,"I have never read a book that was so boring. The book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi. Nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati. WOW,NOT! Weas a class read this book as a class and i asked everyone what they thought of the book. They all agreed with me!"
1662,Negative,A Boring with a German Soldier,"Although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot, it does not. I didn't like the character of Patty, she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much. The relationship between Patty and Anton is very disturbing, becuase Patty is weird about how she reactes when she is around Anton. The book disturbed me."
1663,Positive,Good,This was a present for my boyfriend. He seems to like it. It arrived in a very reasonable time. It seems to be very sturdy and easy to operate.
1664,Positive,Little America,"This book was an interesting reading for me. It was one of the best school readings I have been assigned. It was a up front look at a man looking to uncover his fathers past. His style of writing was upfront and direct. We did not feel compelled to censor his minds work of placing swear words in the text where needed, or being vague about intimate love sessions that had taken place. I most enjoyed the idea of the go-cart club. The inventiveness of having this club to lure in the king is one of the most original ideas that I have read in a long while. The book also has a sense of being a bit personal. I do not know Henry Bromell, only that he is good friends with ny english teacher, but from reading this book I have a sense that I know a little about him. That is why I believe people write books, is to allow the readers to have a brief glimpse inside the authors mind and life. He has, in my opinion, succeeded in doing so with Little America."
1665,Negative,Disappointing,"Fine as an introduction to Duncan, but not for serious study. At best, this is a ""Greatest Hits"" record--though that said, it's a bit like buying Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. It's good in that it touches every portion of his career, but since Duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of ""the book of poetry,"" ultimately it leaves the reader wanting."
1666,Negative,Bad quality zipper,"We outgrew our 8x8 tents with the kids, so we bought this tent preparing for our next camp trip. We test it out at our back yard right after we bought it. It's easy to set up, and roommy. However, the zippers are done in very low end quality. The window zippers work ok, but both the door zipper did not work well! The mesh zipper will open up after you zipped it. The door zipper is not well stiched on one side! And it's hard to zip it around.We are return it back to the store tomorrow!"
1667,Negative,what i thought about this tent,i bought this tent brand new and had it for one year and opened it up one time to put it up and brought on a fishing trip and the string thats in the tent poles broke in 3 places. and the zippers are terrible always get caught.its roomy but its cheap!
1668,Positive,Amazon shipping,This rice cooker works great. My only complaint is with Amazon. This is the 2nd non-book item I've ordered from Amazon and I don't understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing. Thankfully this item arrived in good shape. This is something to think about when ordering non-book items from Amazon.
1669,Positive,Good Anime,"If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it, so its rare I ever complaint about it. Good series having played the games you will enjoy it more. Art style is diffrent its a good different nice change . For the price I paid 13 bucks its worth it"
1670,Negative,I'd rather stick razors into my mouth,"Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap. Compared to Gum brand picks, Doctor's BrushPicks are unusable. The picks have no flexibility or give. Maybe I could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts."
1671,Positive,Best band of all time,This Dvd is amazing. Braid is rock at its finest. If you get a chance you must see them on their reunion tour. The extras are hands down the best on any live dvd I have seen. This knocked the Impossibles Never Say Goodbye Dvd out of my player finally.
1672,Positive,well written and complete but a little dated,"this book was written before the pci express standard was ratified so much of the information is speculative. nevertheless, it is well written and complete."
1673,Negative,Smells Sweaty,"I USED to LOVE this perfume and used for years. But the last two times I bought it from Perfume World or I give someone to use, I have noticed that it smells worse than sweat - horrible. I don’t believe this is the original perfume. Something somewhere is not right with it. But the original (real Paloma Picasso) was excellent. Everyone used to ask me what I was wearing and where to get it! My $60 down the drain! Next time will try to buy from Macys like I used to and see if I can get the original Paloma."
1674,Negative,Unsupported by the Constitution,"Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent, given the prowess with which he manipulates the Constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory. Despite the packaging, however, the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed. He is, at his core, merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career, rather than because they actually have merit. In other words, he's just a hack at heart. This book isn't worth your time or money."
1675,Negative,Not for Hydroponic Growers,"This book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and it's not a very good chapter. As a general book on growing, it's not bad, but anything that purports itself as being a ""grow bible"" should include extensive information on evaluating hydroponics systems and mediums and how to use and maintain them throughout a grow. This book contains some information on this, but not nearly enough. For whatever reasons, it includes far more information on genetics and breeding, but most growers I know buy clones or seeds. Those pages would have been better devoted to all things hydroponics.Is there a good book focused primarily on indoor hydroponic growing? Not sure I need it now, but it would have been great to have a few months back."
1676,Negative,Evident Growing Errors!,"Some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers' garden section. There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book. If you are a beginner or intermediate grower, this book may misguide your gardening efforts. If you want real facts, there are better sources out there."
1677,Positive,Great find!!!!,"This book was a great find! It has more information than pictures which is okay, it is very descript in its information and easy to read. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to further their knowlegde in this art."
1678,Negative,still waiting,This book never shipped. ordered over 6 weeks ago. Smazon still says ships within 1-3 weeks. it has been 4 weeks past their estimated ship date. So don't bother ordering this book.
1679,Negative,boring & pretentious crap!,"This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book.They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead, he comes off as boring and pretentious.Skip this book... try something else."
1680,Negative,Heavy going,"It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful."
1681,Positive,DVD Version please!,I had this VHS tape years ago but no longer own it. I'm looking for the DVD version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable work-outs tapes I've ever done...and I've done a lot of them.
1682,Positive,Very fun video and not hard to follow!,This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
1683,Positive,Fabulous,"For the first time, I read a book in which I thought the artist was sitting in the room and telling me about her life. The is one of the most inspiring, eclectic, and electrifying books I have ever read. It's just fabulous."
1684,Negative,I like Elton but...,I admit I did not read the back of this CD carefully. I happily bought it and popped it into the CD player anticipating the wonderful tunes I had heard throughout the movie. But my favorites weren't there. The most important missing item? It's Tough To Be A God as sung by the stars of the movie. Elton John's duet with Randy Newman just isn't as much fun. It's not a bad album really. I was just disappointed.
1685,Negative,crocodile crock,"The king of Crocodile Rock lost his teeth 25 years ago but here he is -again! - plugging away in geezer FM heaven. While old pharts may love the way John's campy cream puff crooning fluffs up their Depends, kids will absolutely hate this flaccidly-themed soundtrack of paint-by-number sugar pop fizz and bombastic lik-a-stik storytelling. Incredibly, The Road to El Doh!rado is worse than Elt's last Tim Rice collaboration AIDA, the 1999 multi-guest stinker currently being loaded in skeet machines around the world. Indeed, the only level this one works on is a cheap alternative for parents who want to sedate their hyperactive whippersnappers without having to shell out big bucks for a Ritalin prescription. Give it a rest Elton, for gawd's sake."
1686,Negative,not what i had hoped,"i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie, not all resung by elton john. the songs lost the flavor i was looking for. if you're an elton john fan you probably would like it"
1687,Positive,Best Yoga video for kids of ALL ages & abilities,"Totally fun and captivating with creativty for children 3-13 plus lots of stuff for older brothers/sisters as well as Mon/Dad or any extended family member to partake in. Great pace for ALL. Perfect music and voice and a nice outdoor background lending itself to an uplifting and yet mellow mood.Everyone will be inspired to increase their mental/emotional calmness, physical coordination, flexibility as well as focus of mind alone and with friends/family."
1688,Negative,Very slow shipping,The book I ordered was a gift. I am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here. Disappointed in that!
1689,Positive,A Great Book,"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. It gave me even more respect for those of this generation. After reading this book, I had to order Mr. Brokaw's other books."
1690,Positive,The Greatest Generation,Excellent book with profiles of folks who survived WWII and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves. The format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war.
1691,Negative,"Great topic, poor writing style","Tom Brokaw has chosen a fanastic topic: the Baby boomers' parents. Their life & times, trials & stamina through the Depression, war(s), and raising families. I wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would have done the actual writing of this book. As it is, Brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story. I hope this topic gets explored further by someone other than Brokaw, who has little talent as a writer. I was very disappointed reading this book and I made the mistake of buying gift copies for my elderly war vet friend & neighbors, and my own Father without pre-reading it. Live and learn, I guess. Sorry, I had expectations of being thrilled with this book...but wasn't."
1692,Negative,A great disapointment,"Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead, read Studs Terkel's ""The Good War."" It ""is"" what Brokaw could have ""had"", if he would have imitated the master oral biographer."
1693,Negative,Mr.Brokaw concentrated too much on officers,"Mr. brokaw couldn't possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation.Mr.Brokaw found mostly officers to interview,most of whom went into the service as officers,and later became politicians. Where are the uneducated,poverty stricken youths who went into the armed forces,fought and died for their country, and, those who survived,returned to their former lives little better off than before being drafted? The author never mentioned the fact that machinery is always in place to keep our rich youths out of the service,making their service in our armed forces strictly voluntary; and always as officers,most-repeat-,most of whom never heard a shot fired,the exception proving the rule"
1694,Positive,Greatest Generation,"A very moving and informative book. A friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed. After reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in WWII. This book helped me bring me closer to my father.This book is full of stories of WWII vets, what happened to them, and how it changed there life, and how they succeeded."
1695,Positive,Inspiring,"I am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book. The American spirit during WWII is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of Japan and Germany. Whether this generation is the ""greatest"" or not, there is no doubt in my mind that the cooperative effort that was required to defend freedom and defeat the fascists is without a doubt the greatest effort in history."
1696,Negative,A waste of time,"Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation, I'm in the generation that got the bill. This book glossed over most everything. If anything it proved the opposite of its title."
1697,Negative,"Good idea, but shallow text and a distorted picture","Brokaw writes not like a veteran newsman, but like an awestruck, hero-worshipping kid. That's not a crime, but one expects more from a man with Brokaw's experience and training. I felt the text was very shallow -- especially in the final section when he interviews celebrities. One doesn't learn a lot in this section. Nor does one get any meaningful insights. I also felt there was a tremendous ""sameness"" about the interviews. Surely, there were people who had bitter memories or less than passionately patriotic views. Brokaw could have presented a more accurate picture of the generation by including a dissenting opinion or two. Regrettably, one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on NBC News."
1698,Negative,A book of simple hurra patriotism,"I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment. For me, belonging to the post-war generation, it reads as a very shallow ""hurra-patriotism"" story, without any ctitical investigation of the time priode he covers. Not everything this generation did was so great and I would have expected from a critical journalist like Tom Brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well. In this sense it is not very demanding book."
1699,Negative,0.5 g of Trans Fat per serving,"I bought some because it was advertised as ""A healthy snack choice..."" only to find out when it arrived that it has half a gram of trans fat per serving due to its use of a partially hydrogenated oil."
1700,Negative,VTech i6775 Review,"Years ago, I had purchased some VTech products and was very displeased with the their quality. At that time, I swore never to buy VTech again.While recently seeking cordless phones with speakerphone options, I came across the i6775. The price was right, and some time had passed, so I bought two sets (home and office) in June, 2006.There's only a three month warranty on these units, and one set recently (11-2006) died. After finally getting through to VTech support and troubleshooting with them, we couldn't revive the system. The phones are useless, and I'm stuck with them.You can guess my advice."
1701,Negative,No. Just No.,"looks cool. Key word people ""looks"" cool, it isn't bullet proof, please don't think it is, or that pockets make you look the part."
1702,Negative,Tech Analysis is a bunch of BUNK,This book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
1703,Negative,this is not the latest version of the book!,"I bought the book because I think it is of the latest edition (edition 9?). But obviously, it is not, although it is printed in 2008.Amazon should specify the edition of the book!"
1704,Negative,"the paper back edition is a pirated, unauthorized edition",These paper back editions are pirated and unauthorized. They do not contain the modern emendations.DO NOT BE DECEIVED AND IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IT PROTEST TO AMAZON.
1705,Negative,Reprint of a old-edition (1948 ?! ),"The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963. The Amazon's Search-Inside(TM) refer to another update version of the book (9 ed.). The book's style and content is very old, the charts are hand-made and frankly speaking now it's possible to do much better and the calculation of indicators now can be exact. If you are interested to the prehistory of technical analysis a would suggest ""Welles Wilder - New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems"". Modern and better books are those of Achelis and Colby."
1706,Negative,NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND!,"Hello Champions, this IS NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND by downloading it from the band's official website webstore (2SJ.com) where it's available for LESS MONEY and in Hi-Res format!-=AA/2SJ"
1707,Positive,Body Movin',"When you hear the term rap-rock these days, you probably think of artists like Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. But the label applies just as well to 2 Skinnee J's. The J's mix Beastie Boys-style old-school rap with guitar riffs and a healthy dose of humor. Clear some dance space in your bedroom and shout along to the hilarious ""Stockholm Love.""Best Song: ""3 Minutes"""
1708,Positive,Humorous bathroom material,"This is a great bathroom reader. I find that the references to geographical locations as the word names a bit off, but I imagine inventing new words would be quite challenging."
1709,Positive,True Love,"This is a very good CD. There is no song on this CD that I don't like, even though the radio only plays one song."
1710,Positive,A significant book in psychology and the Bible,"Johnson, a clinical psychologist who is a graduate of Fuller Seminary and Fuller Graduate School of Psychology, writes a clear and careful study of the psychological factors that can unconsciously affect the way people read the Bible. He points out how issues of perception, cognitive process, social interaction, and culture can shape how a person interprets scripture. He writes from a committed Evangelical position, and is not by any means reducing the meaning of scripture to merely human processes or psychology. Still, he does caution against the naivete that says, ""I don't interpret the Bible, I just read what it says.""This is an essential volume for anyone interested in psychology, religion, and the Bible."
1711,Positive,big improvment,"My Dell 2650 has 256mb of ram total. More then one program running and it would slow down sometimes freeze. I took out the two 128mb sticks and purchased two of these, getting a total of 512mb. Its still not a lot compared to modern laptops, but it was a noticeable improvement. Now I can get on the internet while a program is running and not have it slow down. Nice product."
1712,Negative,Sounds not like yoga instructor... Really I apologise for my feedback.,"The introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal, loud and unpleasant voice!!! I don't understand it even... But I like Seane demonstration. Seane is a fantastic demonstrator, that's advantage of her. The sequence is really senseless for detox flow. But it's good for beginner without full audio mix.I'd like to ask why the video starts with about 20 minutes of advertisement? Its something they give this DVD as free gift...I tried both workout Twist and flow, Purify... Really its not going to work with detox. Well, I agree that She studied Pattabhi jois Ashtanga yoga sequence with someone and use that for her sequence. Actually here the sun salutation A and B help to open your body, after the body opening, her sequence like warm down your body. I may try with traditional sun salutation with detox flow. Lets see, how its work. Anyhow, I'm not going to play this DVD again."
1713,Negative,not that good,all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey. I only like the first song. the rest....are all CHEEZY!
1714,Positive,"I loved the theme song, ""New Direction!"" It's a hot one!!","I am more of a traditional gospel person but as I mature in the Lord, I'm able to get pass all of the hip-hop and hype of the music and get the message that's being sung. I am a big fan of Percy Grey, Jr. and I think that his helping produce this project is what gave it that taste of ""chuch!"" Overall I say that the project is good and I believe that it will bless the listeners."
1715,Negative,Boring Waste of Time!,"I bought this CD in hopes that some of Destiny's Child's songs would get a better beat or become more interesting for dancing. What I got was a horrible butchering of ""Emotion,"" a never-ending ""Bootylicious,"" a ""Say My Name"" mix anyone would be more than happy to do without and mixes of songs that weren't very good the first time around- several weren't even singles! (Dot, Nasty Girl, So Good)To make that sound better, they throw in Independent Women Pt. II, which is taken directly from ""Survivor,"" and hawk a song from Michelle Williams' upcoming solo debut (Heart to Your, Apr. 16). It's sad when the best song on a group's mix CD is one from the member going solo.I would not recommend this CD at all, if you like Destiny's Child, get Survivor or Writing's on the Wall. If you're looking for good new R&B check out Ashanti instead."
1716,Negative,Fake blue Lights,These lights are not blue.I can't even tell that I've changed mine from stock bulbs.There is absolutely no difference here.They don't deserve one star.Absolutely do not buy these..It's a waste of time and money.CON
1717,Negative,Do not waste your money.....,"I'm a relative neophyte to skiing and bought this with the expectation that it might facilitate my learning. In my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money. Yes, it does provide a modicum of instruction, but for the most part it's suppose to be developing muscle memory by having you watch techniques being repeated ad naseum; didn't work for me.If you want some truly helpful instructional materials, look at the Lito Tejada-Flores and Harold Harb books and tapes."
1718,Positive,60 minutes of encouragement and fun!,"Our whole family loved this video. It is not only a great introduction to skiing for new skiiers in the family (both young and old alike), but also gets you excited and ready to hit the slopes come winter. For intermediates, this is also an excellent review of the basics and some things you might have missed along the way. Don't miss this one!"
1719,Positive,A MUST SEE!!! QUITE HILARIOUS!!!!,I purchased this video for my son (who loves them) and fell in love with it. It is my favorite Veggie Tale to date. A must see!! It is quite hilarious especially the silly song with Larry.
1720,Negative,NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT HERE! 1 1/2 STARS!,"I enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person, but this dreadful film is so forced that I could barely sit through it. Greg Kinnear who is usually very good is flat as a pancake along with his irritating co-star Lauren Holly. There are a few scattered moments (mostly from Joan Cusack), but not not nearly enough to get this awful film off the ground. I rate it 1 1/2 stars because I was somehow able to sit through this lazy comedy with no romance to be found."
1721,Negative,"This is a horrible, horrible movie.",I made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater tried hard to get my money's worth. It was impossible. The dialog was so contrived and mindless. There was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between Kinnear and Holly was nonexistent.
1722,Negative,Died after 2 years,"I read those positive reviews here and bought this item 2 years ago. It worked pretty well at the beginning. Starting from about a year ago, it couldn't keep the rice moistured for long. Now, it is no better than a 20 bucks rice cooker and I have to replace it."
1723,Negative,too slow!,"We bought this rice cooker because everyone raved about it, but no one seems to have mentioned it's one huge drawback: it takes FOREVER. I tried to make two cups of brown rice this evening. After 75 minutes the water was just beginning to boil. As a working mom, I do not have 2 hours to make rice every evening. Yes, I suppose I could get in the habit of setting up my rice in the morning and setting the timer. But this requires a level of menu commitment I don't presently have. Or, I could go back to our old one-button cheapo machine that cooked white rice in 15 minutes, brown in 30. My husband is Asian, but I'm not. He may like the rice better from this machine, but I'm cooking it and I'm fed up."
1724,Negative,Quality of cooked rice went down after about 1.5 years,"For the price, I expected this unit to last longer than my parents' bigger and less expensive cooker (can't remember the brand of their rice cooker--either Panasonic or National) which they've used EVERYDAY for more than five years now, and it's still going.My family didn't use this Zojirushi everyday--but we were pretty close! After about a year and a half, the rice doesn't keep as well as it used to. It dries out faster and doesn't cook as evenly as it did while it was under warranty.I noticed most (if not all) the positive reviews were posted after recent purchases. The handful of reviews from folks who have owned and used this item beyond warranty isn't as glowing. Please keep that in mind if you envision using this rice cooker for years to come."
1725,Negative,Broke in 10 months.,I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
1726,Negative,"Just after 2.5 years, it is toasted","We bought this 2.5 years ago. It was very good at the beginning. However, just after 2.5 years of light use, it is now toasted. The rice comes out sticky and lumpy and drys up in less than 12 hours. We thought Zojirushi stands for quality and durability. We made a big mistake."
1727,Positive,THE little appliance that will.....,"All I can say is that every working, healthy and modern kitchen should have a fuzzy logic rice cooker and by buying a good one that will make Porrige and has other modes, you open it up to providing all kinds of wonderful and creative meals."
1728,Positive,We love it!,I purchased this rice cooker as a Christmas gift for my parents. I was looking for one that also cooked hot cereals or porridge. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. My parents loved it - my mom has Alzheimer's so my dad does all the cooking. He has become an expert at making great yummy hot cereals. Once my husband tasted the hot cereals he ordered a cooker for us as well. The cooker is very easy to clean! We are very happy with it. Ours is made in Japan
1729,Positive,Best white fluffy rice I have ever had!,The rice turned out perfect! Very different from other rice cookers I have tried. I am worried about what the other reviewers mentioned that the battery could out for the LCD display though since I don't intend to plug the machine in all time.
1730,Positive,great item,"I was a little confused by reading reviews but I decided on the goFit ball at 65cm and it worked out just right for my 5'8"" frame. There was no odor from the ball and was not difficult to blow up the ball with the pump provided.Did my abdomial exersizes with no proplem with my 215 lbs of body weight.I would recommend this item."
1731,Positive,Like it,"As other reviews, band around ball showing the exercises is unnecessary and not nice looking. Functions well, no problem with the pump. Use it as an alternative desk chair."
1732,Negative,Way too soft,"It is possible I got a defective ball, but I bought this with the intention of using it for p90x2. I inflated it following the directions precisely, but I found it nearly impossible to perform most of the exercises because the ball compressed so much. It is very high quality and was nearly odorless, but I highly suggest going for a cheaper ball (I'm now using a TKO ball) that is more firm."
1733,Positive,Change the picture please!!!!!!!,"I read the reviews prior to ordering, the color indicated in the photo was purple (which I really wanted) but I took note that several folks received red. I ordered anyway and of course received a red one. In spite of not getting a purple ball I still think it's a good product. Heavy duty, which was important to me since I need to ""trust"" my ball, as I too am heavy duty. It holds it's shape and it's volume of air and I feel very comfortable on it. I'm in a stability ball class and have tried the other balls there and like the weight and feel of my ""red"" ball. I'll probably order another smaller one, a 55cm. The 65cm is great for sitting but a little to large for some of the other activities so I think having a pair of different sizes is the way to go."
1734,Negative,Not been able to inflate it fully yet,We have not figured out gow to inflate it fully yet. The go fit customer service is open only monday - friday 9 - 5.So we haven't used it yet. I think i should have just bought it from a local store. The instructions are quite poor.
1735,Positive,Great purchase,"A coworker of mine had ordered this exact ball and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself. Great value, arrived promptly. This one is fairly large, but I am 6' so it works great for me, shorter folks might want to try one of the smaller ones."
1736,Positive,"Big, tough and relatively easy to inflate","This ball is extremely durable, a great size and was easy to inflate. For tall people, it is excellent. The skin is thick and we have had no issues with it, and do not feel any danger of it popping."
1737,Positive,Having fun with the ball,"My husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using. It has served that purpose very well, and also our kids love it. It's pretty big, so to them it's the ultimate toy. I'm happy its anti-burst, and I can see us using it for many years, it is very quality."
1738,Positive,comprehensive book,This book contains a myriad of case studies concerning a wide variety of acoustical problems. Very rich in detail. I found it helpful when trying to tackle challenging acoustical problems.
1739,Negative,Huh???,This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat. I like Toby Keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three CD's (None of which are any good or have any worth) and make an extra buck. It's just sad.
1740,Negative,Effortless and Misleading,"When I bought this box set, I expected to recieve compact discs that were fully remastered with 24 Bit Technology. Instead, they sound exactly like the original discs I already have. While you may find several top quality country hits in this set, the sound quality isn't up to snuff for today's standards. So now I'm stuck with doubles of everything and out thrity bucks."
1741,Positive,What is this gorgeous chaos ?,Just buy this album. 'Dry the rain' is the best song ever. 'Dog's got a bone' is close to being the best ballad ever. Each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake. Push it out. Feel the Beta vibe.
1742,Positive,"thoroughly enjoyable, respecatble","Thank goodness for the Beta Band! I must say this album is a real treat for the ears- sonically broad, lyrically uplifting, and overall a good time for all. Kinda like if Graham Parsons spliced his genes with Beck Hanson, had a daughter, who then married David Byrne and had a mess of kids, thereby amounting to the Beta Band. Musically, it's that hard to pin them down, and that's a good thing. Definitely an album that can be enjoyed for ages on end- the only drawback I felt was the appropriately titled 'Monolith'. But hey everyone is entitled to their madness."
1743,Positive,A great guide in simple terms!,"A great, comprehensive guide that helped me to understand why this happened in a historical context. Also helped me to get a better grasp of what to expect with the war against Afghanistan and Al Qaeda. Now I know why this happened and what to expect. The news media seems to breeze over historical elements in favor of status quo Anthrax and millitary events but this book really helped me to get caught up on my facts. Highly recommended!"
1744,Positive,"more than ""disco""","In the begining thier was house.......and before that thier was SALSOUL!!!! The root of house music started with salsoul. This cd captures some of the best songs that they produced. To say that this is just another disco cd, would be doing it a grave disjustice. It would be like calling the Mona Lisa just a painting or the statue of Dave just a rock. This is a compilation of the best dance music ever recorded. The blend of rebel rosing vocals and smooth lyrical contents with the monstrative rythems are timeless classics. My only regret is they didn't release all of thier gems out on one compliation. This is a must have for any disco, house, dance, or r&b collection."
1745,Positive,Childhood favorite,"This was an important book to me when I was a little girl growing up in Colorado. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked it out of the library to read and reread again. I even remember where it was -- second shelf from the end, three row up, reddish hardback cover.Over the years I'd forgotten the title, I just remembered that it was about a little Native American girl who climbed a tree and found another world in the sky. After a tedious search of my old towns online library (yay for modern internet searches) I found a title that rung a bell and won a copy on ebay!I'm so happy to have this book on my shelf now. Wonderful, wonderful story."
1746,Positive,Delightful,"I loved this book as a young girl. I loved the message about finding your talents and making the most of them, even when you are feeling out of place or far from all that is familiar. I've been looking for it for my children for years and am so thrilled to have finally found it!"
1747,Negative,You Get What You Pay For!,"I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -""you get what you pay for"""
1748,Positive,Oscar de la Renta Eau De Toilette 8.0 Oz.,"My wife thinks this product is identical to the product we found in local stores, but at a much lower price per ounce. She has been using this product for years."
1749,Negative,Hate it,"We hate this thing. Hate. Hate. Hate.Even though it is supposed to hold three bikes, we can't even get two bikes on it, they are so squished together.Every time we try to use it, we just get covered in grease, angry, and abandon all hope of ever riding bikes somewhere that is not at home.Foaming raging hatred."
1750,Negative,Serious flaw with this bike rack. Screws made of PLASTIC!,"At first glance this rack seems well designed. In fact when I first put it on my car it felt very secure. However, after 3 days I noticed that one of the inner arms was loose. On closer inspection I realized that the screw that tightens the arm was defective and wouldn't tighten. After pulling it out I wasn't surprised because the screw is made of plastic. I couldn't believe it. The entire rack was total garbage because of one plastic screw. The screw is not replaceable with something from your local hardware store either. It is a specialty screw with a large cap on it that lets you hand tighten it. I can't believe that Saris would do this just to save a few bucks. This rack went back to Amazon and good riddance."
1751,Negative,Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors,"The Quality is tenth rate, this DVD is almost unwatchable and the audio sucks."
1752,Negative,Good show. Bad release.,"Air is a pretty decent show, though not quite as good as Kanon and Clannad that came afterwards. ADV also gave it a great dub. But it's not worth buying this set. Not only does it cram all the episodes onto two discs, with Funi's usually bad AV quality as a result, but it also strips one of the episodes from the series. It may only be a recap episode, but it's still part of the show.This is not a complete collection, and not worth buying."
1753,Positive,Heller with a gun,This novel takes you from a warm fire to the icy wastes and carries you on a wild flight to survive the elements and overcome the threat to innocent travellers. A excellent adventure with a unexpected ending.
1754,Negative,Best Keep As A Secret,"This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast), close to nonexistence suspense, and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog (English accents and all that). Gielgud's performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional (when you can understand his delivery); as the heroine, Carroll's ""acting"" ranges from chatty to zombie; and Lorrie's delivery is over-the-top ham (and, quite frankly, an embarrassment) as he portrays the ""good-guy"" killer. All this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer, Robert Young. Young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film. He makes the film his own!There are some gee-wiz (for the time, 1936) special in-camera/editing effects which were then fast becoming (and would continue to be) a Hitchcock trademark.Not one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but not one of his disasters either.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D"
1755,Positive,Start here,"These three discs are a perfect place to begin your Stereolab collection as it covers a wide cross section of ""the stereolab sound"".And the music...??? just look up the individual disc reviews on Amazon.It's all there....Enjoy"
1756,Negative,Not what I Thought,"I bought this book thinking this was Historical fiction...I was wrong, this is trash, one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read, he doesn't know squat, and his characters are ludicrous, badly written and boring."
1757,Positive,tactful approach to adolescent obesity,This movie is very enjoyable and handles the topic of adolescent obesity and eating disorders very tactfully. Could be shown in high school health classes.
1758,Negative,Below Par,"I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff. Someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the USGA publicity director, but I am at loss to understand whom."
1759,Positive,Another great Feinstein golf book,"Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books, A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors. Instead of stories about the players on the tour, this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the worn-out municipal golf course Bethpage Black into the great course that hosted the 2002 U.S. Open championship. I found I couldn't stop reading, as Feinstein's prose is once again funny, heartwarming, and flowing. My only critique is that I wished for more detail on Rees Jones' changes to A.G. Tillinghast's design, with illustrations. For a book about the transformation of the golf course, there isn't enough about the physical changes that were done. The book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken, so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved."
1760,Negative,A Good Open Spoiled,"The subtitle should be, ""Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black,"" because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, ""A Good Open Spoiled."" Don't waste your money."
1761,Positive,Deadliest Plane Crash reveiew,"DVD was in excellent condition, brand new. The Film is very good, well made, very good visuals to go with the story telling, however, this is a short version of the original film, that is the only negative of this production."
1762,Positive,"One of the Best Texts in ""Calculus Reform""","If you read it through and through, you will find how wonderful it is to approach calculus in a graphical, numerical and symbolic way. If you want to challenge your mind in this way, this book is probably the most suitable for you. I am using it in my calculus calss, and I found the concepts are very clearly explained. The thing that I love most of this book is that it helps students develop a good understanding of calculus through observing and studying the graphs of the functions. This only imperfection of the book, if any, is that there lack of some theoretical exercises. But any book can not be perfect. The most important thing is how you enjoy it. For me, it is a new and fresh guide of the study of calculus."
1763,Negative,Nearly useless as a calculus textbook,"I am a fan of traditional theorem-proof exposition, and this Ostebee-Zorn text demonstrates why. This book attempts to make calculus easy to understand, but the only result is that it is impossible to follow. Essential concepts are buried deep within piles of verbiage, and the examples skip important steps making them hard to follow. Add to that the large number of typos and errors in the solutions manual. As a teaching assistant, I have had strong mathematics students who could not understand this book and whose knowledge of calculus suffered as a result. With so many quality calculus textbooks on the market, it is hard to understand why a school would choose to use this unsuccessful experiment."
1764,Negative,I wouldn't recommend this book....too much dam sex!,"I wouldn't recommend this book...I believe that Roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going....I didn't enjoy reading Goodbye, Columbus, but I did enjoy reading the short stories where it is not about sex but rather about religion. thank you for the short stories...."
1765,Negative,Drunk SpongeBob?? A Disappointing movie.,"NOTE FOR PARENTS: What was Nickolodeon thinking?? SpongeBob and Patrick stuff themselves with sundaes then behave like drunks...down to the staggering about, talking with slurred speech, and suffering from a hangover the next morning on an unshaven, bleary-eyed SpongeBob. The scene could have easily been played with stomachaches.Also, the movie features Patrick in black fishnet hose and stiletto heels- I kid you not!My sons, fans of SpongeBob on TV, rarely laughed and pronounced it 'sorta OK'. We all wished we'd seen someting else. The story was contrived and not even clever.Watch the show- don't bother seeing the movie."
1766,Negative,100% CR**!,"What the f**k is this? The TV show was funnier than this garbage! People who doesn't have seen this movie, DON'T SEE IT! It's a yasste of time and money!"
1767,Positive,Great movie,I loved this movie. It's about Sponge Bob and Patrick going to Shell City to get King Neptune's crown. ANd while SB and P are going to Shell City Plankton takes over the world. IT's a great movie. See it.
1768,Negative,Worst Movie in years!!,"This is just pethetic! I don't get the point of watching the movie. There was abot hmm... 2..3 funny parts that don't EVEN GO WITH THE MOVIE! Even my dad fell asleep in the movie. I should'nt even tell you the stroy. It's so STUPID! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT! IF you buy, I hope you enjoy being bored."
1769,Negative,the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever!!!!,"I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy, but when I watched this movie I almost lost my head because of the awful it was! This is actually ""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever"", the critics here in Chile said that and I totally agree with them.The worst thing the producers could do was to include real people and stupid effects that make you laugh in the movie. Like David Hasselhoff, the made fun of himself by acting here!!!! plus, the stupid effect when he starts acting as if he was a boat or something, I had self-shame when I watched that part!!!!!I think that the worst thing you could do is to buy this DVD: you'll watch it once, you'll hate it and you'll waste 18 bucks. Bad purchase."
1770,Positive,Great case,I've built three computers for family using this case and they all love it. A bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height. Glossy black piano finish.... it only appears cramped if you fail to plan... I use modular P/S and tie down all the cords ...getting ready to buy another.
1771,Negative,James Herriot's Dog Stories,"Out of all the shopping I have done through Amazon, this is the only thing I will be returning! The book only measures 6 3/4 x 4 1/4, has very small print and obscure black and white illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. In the same order I received James Herriot's ""Treasury for Children"" which, for the same price, is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, and what I also expected from this book!"
1772,Positive,Not for dog lovers only,"James Herriot's Dog Stories is written by a man who loves both people and animals. The descriptions of people, dogs, and his humble view of himself are an irresistable combination. The accuracy and wit with which he presents people's relationships with their dogs is priceless. When I read this book, I laugh at the eternal goofiness of dogs and also dog people! The sadder stories are written with a balanced view. This book is an amazing collection of short stories. Highly recommended."
1773,Positive,Really fun stuff,"It is hard to believe that this is no longer available new on Amazon. I think this is a great CD with jazz and bluegrass all mixed together. If you want to call it progressive, that works too. Anyway, it is great music. Buy it!!"
1774,Negative,"great songs, horrible sound transfer","It is simply not worth wasting your money even on songs of the sixties so fine as these, since the sound qualities of this disc are so poor as to completely ruin the listening experience. I used to have this on vinyl lp and should have kept it. The sound was great back then. The CD is nothing but scratches and hisses. Disgraceful."
1775,Positive,The most versitile shirt you will ever own.,"This shirt is great by itself, under an cotton shirt, under sholder pads, and even under a coldgear shirt. The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it. This a must have for your under armour wardrobe."
1776,Positive,greatest eyebrow product ever made,"I tried this product when they used to sell it at Walgreens, as soon as I fell in love with it they stopped selling it. I can't seem to find a place anywhere who sells it. Its pain free and works really really well for something that looks like a sticker. I don't even get my eyebrows professionally done. I use these shapers above my brow and tweeze underneath. They make my eyebrows look perfect!"
1777,Positive,You Nasty,"Short remains steadfast w/this release. Production varies, even E. Sermon drops by w/a dope beat for Short to spit to. If you're a fan you will not be dissapointed. His lyrical pimp hand remains strong throughout the duration of the record. Add it to your collection! PEACE"
1778,Negative,Big waste of money (and space in my house!),"My 5 year old son wanted this so bad, but when we got it for him, there were so many pieces to put together that didn't fit together well, he never played with it. It just sits on our floor in many pieces taking up toy space! What a waste!"
1779,Positive,Raining Stones at a Start of it all,"Remember "" Don`t play your Rock`n Roll to me "" from Smokie? No? The Gallaghers gave a f... on that. They did what they can give but this one was not to the hand of God... The Following Album after this was going on Jesus Christ Ways; only 4 Albums on the World have the right beeing 6 points on Amazon. Defintiley Maybe this is not 6 points but a full 5.00000 ...."
1780,Positive,Nebula Awards are synonymous with great SF,Nebula Awards Showcase 2006 is another collection of stories that you read and don't forget immediately. Another great-deal-treasure through Amazon.
1781,Negative,Disappointing,"This book was suggested reading as if "" THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM"" was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view."
1782,Positive,Happy with the product,I have had the case for a month now and I am very happy with it so far. The case holds my TX nicely. No problems with the belt clip either. Very good product for the price.
1783,Positive,Palm case,I love this case. It is very hard to keep my palm protected. I carry my palm in my pocket everyday at work. Befor this case sometimes my lab jacket would get caught in the car door and the door would get slamed on my palm. This case prevents any damage. I LOVE IT!
1784,Positive,"Good, but some songs were alittle to hip-hop for me.",I liked Soulbait alittle better than this. But Blaze is still good. I like the futuristic effects on the songs and how they designed the album cover.
1785,Negative,Legal Mumbo Jumbo,"This is truthfully worthless books. I had counted at least 20 typos on this book. I also do not like the double space to make this book look volumnious which it is not. It is basically a flyer which is printed in the form of a book. The litigation only contains New York, and that is too outmoded. Truthfully, it was a waste of time and money to buy this book. It creates the impression that the doors to a very secretive knowledge would be open to you but the knowledge given in this book is very basic which I am sure any reader worth their salt attempting to venture into this territory might already knows. Truthfully, I was disappointed to read this book."
1786,Positive,Terrific Reference,"As a banker, one never wants to have to be in the position of collecting bad debts. Mr. Lewis has done a great job describing the process -- a terrific reference for anyone who needs an experienced perspective on the process!"
1787,Negative,Love of Siam,"This budding romance is a bit...slow. I was a bit disappointed with the story line but then again, I find it quite difficult for Asians to do a well coming out or coming of age story. This is my opinion. I would reccomend that you save your money and not view it."
1788,Negative,Pretty and very BORING!,"WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my 1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell, if you're under 15 yrs old, you will love this game! If not, spit on it. What a waste."
1789,Negative,why do you pay someone to write your reviews?,"I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction. The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro. Don't believe me.......read the other ""reviews"" they have left. Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written."
1790,Positive,Enjoyable and Instructive,"I bought the Drawing & Painting Fantasy Beasts and the Fantasy Figures books for our high school library. The kids really enjoy them and so do I. I just signed on to see what else might be in this series and to order more copies. While these books may not appeal to everyone (not enough step-by-step for true beginners), the layout and abundance of good pictures and ideas will grab most readers and artists."
1791,Positive,HOLIDAY TREASURE,"Barry Corbin ends up with a Korean family that he never knew he had. He is gruff and not accepting of his visitors, not even friendly, but soon mellows during the Christmas season. The usual characters are here - a wonderful series that should have lasted longer. This chapter is just another example of great acting and terrific writing. I enjoyed the old VHS and it arrived in perfect shape. Wonderful, family entertainment."
1792,Positive,A very good book.,"Normally I am the kind of person who goes for books with adventure and fantasy in them. But hey, I tried this one out and loved it. It's not as fast paced as some of the books I've read, but that suprisingly didn't matter. I suggest anyone read it."
1793,Negative,NaST like a teST,I am in college now and i had to take a teST on this book when i was i the seventh grade. At that time i hated the book. i thought it was even more naST than Jhonny Tremain. i just wanted to make a mast on that book. it was so boring i just fell asleep. i would not reccomend this book to anyone and i would tell someone to read The Future of Us instead. i just fealt like making a naST in this book and putting it away so when the next person like juSTice reads it they would see my naST and think the book was naST. what a disappointment
1794,Negative,Only one part was good in this whole book,"This book is about some girl from Barbados named Kit Tyler who has to move to Wethersfield, Connecticut. First of all, the characters are the most boring people in the world. The plot stinks. There barely is a plot. I like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way. This book, there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground (just to let you know I'm being metaphoric here) and then go up a little hill. The only reason I actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where Kit is running away is kind of suspenseful. Just don't read this book it isn't good."
1795,Negative,OK,"This book was ok to me. It dragged on quite a bit but I really liked the ending. I didn't like how it would talk about the same thing for over 3 chapters. It just felt like it wasn't my kind of book. However, I liked the last part. The last 5 chapters were probably that only part I liked."
1796,Negative,Boring,"After purchasing this for our home library, I couldn't wait to read it before my children did. I was bored and unenthused throughout the reading. The author made great attempts at historical accuracy, just not enough with character or plot development. The story must have been born of facts first, as the characters just seemed thrown about and inconsistent. Along with the lack of plot, those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read. I can't imagine either of my young avid readers enjoying this book and all its predictabilities."
1797,Negative,Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones,"I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse, it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure. Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about. The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt. Nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures. The characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence."
1798,Positive,Love this book,I have read this book several times since I was a pre-teen. It's like visiting an old friend each time. I love it. One of my all time favorites.
1799,Positive,The Witch of Blackbird Pond,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good book. It is about the early American settlers, the Puritans and their witch trials. Kit has recently moved to America from a Barbadoes after her father's death. What she finds there are strict religious rules, pious settlers, and bad fashion. But she takes refuge in the company of Hannah, who is called evil because she is a Quaker. When Hannah is acused of casting sickness on the town and escapes, the town acuses Kit. In the end, Kit must learn to change her attitude and the town must learn to conquer religious differences."
1800,Negative,An interesting but predictible book,"This book was semi interesting. I liked certain parts, but compared to other books, this one was too predictible. I prefered the book, Beyond the Burning Time. Not only was it better, it was less predictable and more interesting! But read the two books for yourself and you can decide!"
1801,Negative,A Girl who lost everything takes her chances in Wethersfield,"This book was an overall 1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic. This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action. The characters, however were very interesting and original. The events were very boring and predictable."
1802,Positive,A Joy to Read,"This book was a wonderfully light and entertaining read. Kit is a young girl who is forced to leave her island home of Barbados in the late 1600's and live with a strict Puritan community in Connecticut. She has many new relationships some good and some bad in this land where life seems so harsh. One of her special relationships is with an elderly Quaker woman, the Witch of Blackbird Pond. The author is detailed in showing early New England life. The characters are a charming and I will always remember Hannah Tupper. A fabulous book for adults, young and old."
1803,Positive,The perfect choice!,"When we purchased a new sofa that has a recliner on each end, we needed a table to sit in front of the middle seat when it's just the two of us. One that we could reach items from either recliner. This table has beautiful smooth wood; it's the right size & serves as the perfect companion when we settle down to a night of TV."
1804,Positive,Good Buy,"This book gives some good advice on the essay, but an awful lot of the book is not related how to put together your best essay. I bought this after the book ""A is For Admission"" recommended it. I had much higher expectations for it because of that."
1805,Positive,True sons of Merengue.,"They have that unmistakable beet like their fathers. Which is always good to hear. But they have managed to do create a new style, whch is what makes this one ""mortal"". As soon as I saw them do one of their songs on TV, I went out to buy it. I wasn't disappointed. It is extremely danceable. I also love the name and what it means."
1806,Positive,this music will take your words from you,"one of the best albums....................ever. any genre, any era. my god, what a knock out. this is the latest musical persona of will oldham (whose illustrious career began as ""palace/palace music/palace brothers"") and many say it's his greatest achievement yet. i knew within ten seconds of first hearing this record that it had to be true. every song reaches in and squeezes the heart, gets all tangled up in your insides. you know what's great about this record? every single haunting track is memorable and affecting. every one. there isn't a single track that fades into the background...and that is a rare treat these days. and the fact that a tune as staggeringly vibrant as ""a minor place"" can co-exist so easily with smothering odes like ""i see a darkness"" is just amazing. it is, in many ways, like life."
1807,Positive,Perversely Uplifting,"I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question. Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan. I, myself not being much of a writer, will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia.com and nme.com."
1808,Negative,"urethane coating, how about all urethane",It is my girls first year in ballet so I just wanted an inexpensive bag. If you want a really nice bag don't waste your money here. The entire bag is made of urethane and has a cheap feel. The biggest positives are the cute graphics and the straps work well.
1809,Positive,RI-ON's Plot - Dragon Drive Volume 8,"My cousin got this the second it came out, and the amazing action and friendship as well as the ""Who do you trust?"" undertone continue greatly in this DVD with the introduction of new animation for the theme, ""True"", as well as the introduction of the character Hideaki. Whose side is he really on, and is he even human? This DVD will keep you on the end of your seat. Dragon Drive fans, you're in for a treat as the final battle is being prepared for!"
1810,Negative,Why do I have to give this any stars?,"If you like good music don't waste 12 bucks. May the record stand, I didn't want this CD. My Sister bought it for me. Their anoying voices and pathetic melodies are, well, annoying and pathetic. No good will come of buying this. Spend your money on a good CD like EVERCLEAR or FASTBALL."
1811,Negative,this album suxxxx,i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes.......it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same.....get What's the story morning glory....it rocks
1812,Negative,Not all that,"I am a Oasis fan and to be honest Be Here Now isn't very good . The only good songs are d'you know what i mean , magic pie , stand by me and all around the world {which is too long } . Its no where near as good as the others and isn't worth the money"
1813,Negative,"not terrible, but really not good enough","this is a poor attempt at a follow up to morning glory. I wouldn't say its terrible, but I wouldn't buy it again if given the choice, which is a shame really, because their first two were quite good"
1814,Negative,"WORN OUT, WASHED UP HAS-BEENS","I don't have to hear only new music all the time, but I must say that Oasis' ""Be Here Now"" is one album I'd just as soon forget forever. If ""What's the Story Morning Glory"" defined and popularized Brit-pop, ""Be Here Now"" sounded its death knell! I will admit that the sound is much like older Oasis recordings, but that's just the problem. It's TOO much like the older stuff and sounds suspiciously like the Gallaghers were in a hurry to turn out something - anything - a.s.a.p. What makes this album so bad is that it was hyped SO much, which left this Oasis fan with a sharp sense of being taken for a ride. Oasis may be the most popular British band, but they aren't the best. Much British talent goes unnoticed overseas (i.e. Silver Sun, the Dandys, Shed Seven, Catatonia, Northern Uproar), and that's a shame! Save your money for something more original than ""Be Here Now."""
1815,Positive,A terrific follow-up to their last album.,"I loved Oasis' first US album, What's The Story Morning Glory?, and this was a wonderful follow-up. The music is crisp, fresh, and has catchy melodies that keep you listening. I love Oasis and I love this CD!"
1816,Negative,Another example of cocaine-fuelled excess,"Be Here Now does have its moments (""D'You Know What I Mean"", ""My Big Mouth"", ""Stand By Me"", and ""Don't Go Away"") along with a few lesser tracks (""All Around The World"" and ""It's Getting Better Man"") and a true dog (""Magic Pie""), but it's just another example of what happens when you're worth $40,000,000, the cocaine supply is never-ending (Noel Gallagher has admitted this and stopped using), and you ask how long a CD is (74 minutes) and you say, ""Well, let's fill the <expletive> up"".The production is awful. Knobs-up, full stop. Layers and layers of squalling guitars. All hints of subtleness are gone except for the end part of ""Don't Go Away"". The band still rocks out, but the sound is harsh.I almost gave it three stars because of the decent songs on here, but I've got to deduct one star for the ""Phil Spector with hearing damage"" style of production. Sorry guys. Find a better producer next time out."
1817,Negative,Boring...,"The songs in this album are quite boring, only a few good ones. I wouldn't recommend it, get their previous albums instead..."
1818,Positive,This one amazing album!!!,"I like Oasis because their songs are rhythmic and I like the lead singer's voice. All of their songs have a different rhythmic and all songs are really good. There are 12 songs on this album. I like the 4th song "" STAND BY ME "" because it's really nice when they say ` stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be ` I like these parts!!! And the 8th song "" DON'T GO AWAY "" is good , too. I found this song is for when something sad has happened to you; It's one of the best song in this album!! So I think this album is fantastic!!!!! I want Oasis to sing many songs."
1819,Positive,Thank god we have Oasis!,"These album is their best work yet, the songs are an interesting conbination of the songs from the albums they did before. The songs has the basic things from the first record, and the elegancy and sofistication of ""What the story morning glory"" as well, you will hear more details in these one.These is the band of the 90's...and they will be the band of the 2000's of course, so buy it now. Noel is a tired and true music god."
1820,Positive,Top one!! Mad for it,Why do Yankees always put Oasis down eh? They are the Greatest band ever. I live in the same City as they did and I'm listening to their music 24/7 People just get jealous of their success. If anyone agrees or disagrees e-mail me instantly!!!!
1821,Positive,You have to know what your doing,This plane takes alot to get off the ground you really have to throw this thing but once its up there your good to go i would recommend to stand on top of hill and throw it so it has more of a chance getting airborne.
1822,Positive,Billy Joel My Life single,When I purchased this cd I did not know what to expect. I have been a Billy Joel fan for my whole life. I was very surprised during the first listen. Even though it sounded something like Frank Sinatra would write it still has the Billy Joel feel. Both with the music and timing. As this fan grows older this is a welcome sound. I hope there is more to come. Joseph Leonardi
1823,Positive,Great book,Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!
1824,Positive,Fun Read!,"This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd, at least to me, but the rest of the story kept me interested.Since it's an older story, it's really great for adults like me who love ""old-school"" sci-fi. My son wasn't grabbed by it, by the way. So not sure if it's great for kids."
1825,Positive,"The Gadget is it ""Too Good""","The Gadget by Paul Zindel is about a thirteen year old Stephen Orr. His Father is a scientist that works for the Goverment in the time period of the 1940's. If you are person who likes history and science this book is perfect. Stephen is a person who i can relate to becasue i know a person just like him. Matt Hadsell. They both like to explore the unknow and discover the undiceded. As my title says ""Too Good"" thats exactly what this book is, so if you like reading or just want an intersting read, the Gadget is right for you."
1826,Negative,wrong book right title,We were trying to get winter of the world by Ken Follet. So when thats avialble I will order it corretly this time. Dave
1827,Positive,nice Pitcher,Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
1828,Positive,excellent,perfect for frothing. well built product. would buyanother in a heartbeat.no more dribbles from a roundedged vessel i was using previously.
1829,Positive,"Works well, is a bit hard to clean","I've been using the carafe for 3 months, and generally speaking a pleasure to use. it's decently constructed (though by no means heavy duty), and it's lasted so far, even though I'm not gentle on things.My only real complain is that because the carafe narrows at the top, and it's rather tall, it's hard to clean the bottom without a brush."
1830,Positive,Frothing Pitcher,Given as a gift today to go with recipients coffee maker.They used it for their guests same day (!) and really likedappreciated the size and quality of the pitcher. It's a perfectsize to give you the option of quantity to make.
1831,Positive,The Fall of Reach,"This book is very good. The story line is fantastic and I cannot put it down. There is one problem, however. This book was very poorly proofread if proofread at all. There are many grammatical mistakes and other errors that middle school students could eliminate if they had read their work. Nonetheless, I highly recommend The Fall of reach and the rest of the series as long as you are able to overlook certain imperfections."
1832,Positive,These books Rock!,"Growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more. They pull you into the Halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters. Great stories and insight into the award winning game, Halo. After reading it I wanted to play some Halo and kick some Covenant rear!"
1833,Positive,Typos Galore,"I'm almost finished with The Fall of Reach and while I love the story, the editors need to be shot. Wherever there is a word that has the letters ""f"" and ""i"" together, they're missing; ie: file is le, and officer is of cer. I think there's a date typo too where it's supposed to be the day after and they didn't change it. It's a little confusing and takes from the read when you have to pause and figure out what's being said. I'll update or comment when I finish the other 2 books, hopefully they're not as bad."
1834,Negative,Stop Screaming,"Now, I am a HUGE fan of Jack Off Jill, My Ruin, Otep ect... And those chicks can scream. However, the vocalist of Sugarcoma fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak screaming. The singers oj JOJ, MR, Otep ect... Put power behing their music and make it enjoyable. Sugarcoma just makes it annoying. She does have a nice singing voice, and the band is very talented. I think Sugarcoma would be better off if she didnt scream..."
1835,Positive,A Valuable Gift,"When you are at a loss to communicate, much less comfort a friend who has experienced a death, this book can speak for you! Consider giving it as a gift, more personal and more everlasting than flowers. If you have lost a loved one, take this book as your own companion to help you move through your grief. Someone who understands is waiting in this book to support your journey. It will help."
1836,Negative,Pass on this one,"This book was not what I expected. The author spends much valuable time describing his personal trials and tribulations with the Russian ""system"" rather than explaining the what, how, where, and gory details of biological warfare. If you are looking for an exciting read, pass on this one...I did read the whole thing and I can guarantee it will put you to sleep every time you pick it up!"
1837,Positive,THE HUMPER STILL DEFINES (AND REDEFINES) LOVE,"If you can get past the cover and inside photos --- a Humper who looks suspiciously surgically streamlined --- you will be for a warm, fuzzy surprise. The Humper still has it: smooth vocals with a blend of country and pop and the softest of rock possible, all showcased with his three-and-a-half octave range. There are covers --- ""Volare,"" ""Penny Lane"" (perhaps an homage to The Beatles, the group whom he knocked off the charts with his No. 1 hit, ""Release Me""), ""If Tomorrow Never Comes,"" ""This Guy's in Love With You"" and the underrated Aznavour anthem ""She."" There's an infectious taste of calypso with ""Brazil,"" and a truly likable country-flavored "" How Slow We Go,"" co-written by the Humper's daughter, Louise. The best track is the title track, ""Definition of Love"" --- proof, indeed, that the man still defines love. Now a bad way to celebrate 35 years in the business of making love on the record."
1838,Positive,It was pretty good,"I enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things. However, he seemed to repeat the information a lot (guess repetition is the key to memory). It was to a point that annoyed me though, then again repetition annoys me period. lol. Also, somethings kinda contradicted themselves, but for the most part it was a pretty decent book and I did learn some things and def recommend this vs regular running relying on super thick soles praying the shoe will protect you. Which will! give you more injuries later down the road."
1839,Positive,If you run you have to give it a try,"I read ChiRunning in Sep 09. It took me 2-3 wks to get the form right while running. I've been ChiRunning since.It's not effortless - my heart rate meter tells me so - though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints. I now run 4x a week, an hour or two each time. This is something I'd never been able to do in the past because my knees always started giving problems and I'd have to train on an elliptical afterwards. The knees are fine now. I'm sure Danny wouldn't recommend it, but you can even run on a bad knee with this technique - I ran 10k on a poor knee without much loss of speed.My timing has also improved, though not as much as I'd hoped or expected (hence 4 stars).Enjoy running? You should give it a go."
1840,Negative,Not worth the time,"I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old, maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated. However, my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother. If you want helpful, non-opinionated advice, this is not the book for you. Currently I'm reading ""The Working Mother's Guide to Life"" which seems much more friendly and helpful."
1841,Negative,Wha?,"I don't get this CD. I listened to it, listened to it again, chased my cat, cheeseyfranks, with a Salisbury steak TV dinner, listened to it again and nope, nothing. It's more average rock by bands that Mark Knopfler should put over his knee and whoop with a copy of Procol Harum's Las Vegas comeback effort. It's junk. Kroll was all about Sparta about 6 months ago before a telemarketer talked him into some psychic network. He now tells me that my oatmeal may jump up and start singing showtunes if my aura is not in line. Anyway, Sparta is a waste of time only Saved by the Bell, the pre school years, can compete with."
1842,Negative,take a peak first,"A fast read, has some helpful teaching points and very general commentary on japanese society. Seems a bit outdated too, at least my 1992 edition does. A lot of time spent covering things you could easily look up on the web. If you are going to Japan through JET, you will have heard a lot of this stuff by the time you get to Japan. Definitely check this out in a bookstore before buying, probably give it a pass."
1843,Positive,"Amazing song, great performance, wonderful voices!","Mariah and Whitney are (together with Celine Dion and Aretha Franklin) the greatest singers alive! They really show their voices power in this song, and they made a wonderful job together! Well done, girls! Well done!"
1844,Positive,Generally good; viewing angle annoying,"I agree with most of what the previous reviewer said. What I dislike most is the are extremely narrow viewing angle and the lack of antireflective coating. Otherwise, it is a generally good device.My wish list for the next version includes built-in Wi-Fi and the ability to browse the network neighborhood and pull media files from any machine on the local wireless network, and an internet browser :-)"
1845,Negative,Doesn't Work!,"For all the famous names in this movie, soomething better should have come out of it. It was predictable from the first, and the twists and turns were just silly. They couldn't leave the estate, although one of them managed to arrive from the outside. Just about every one was involved in something illicit, or at least in something strange. Lovers were talked about but not really discussed. The biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it. This movie was just an unrelated bunch of snippets that just doesn't work."
1846,Positive,8 BEAUTIFUL WOMEN,"During a snowstorm, eight women are stranded in a French country home with the corpse of the murdered family patriarch. Slightly bizarre, low-key French film pokes fun at the comedy murder mystery genre while heralding the feminine mystique of domesticity and dominance. It has the added distinction of breaking into song from each of the eight principal players, a strangely satisfying technique that often delivers touching portraits of womankind. This is as intoxicating as a glass of fine French wine."
1847,Positive,The passion for life is ageless,"Zorba the greek is a novel that has inspired me since I was a child. Alexis is a man that has this atomic reactor in his body that he cannot control. The coal mine owner, his boss, starts to realize little by little what Zorba is all about. Despite that his worker is not educated he learns a lot about life from him. This kind of novel is the one you do not forget and in my case is present for many situations. Zorba is never let down by failure or tragedy, take your shoes off and dance to the rhytm of life !!"
1848,Negative,Pretty Good...,"I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless."
1849,Negative,buyer BEWARE!,"This was the worst pair of headphones I've ever bought, and it was not easy to get the local Bose store to give me a full refund on them despite their advertised ""no hassle refund"" policy.Terrible sound, poor ergonomics, medicore ""noise cancellation""---never again will I buy another Bose product! I should've known better, my husband has a ridiculous Bose Wave radio which he now tells everyone that he ""won at a Christmas raffle at the office"" because he's too embarassed to confess that he paid half a grand for the thing.My son pointed me towards a pair of Sennheisers which were better in every respect, and at one third of the price."
1850,Positive,Great Headphones,"I use these for blocking out noise at the office, and then take them home for gaming. They are very versatile and the sound quality is very good. They do a great job of blocking out external noise, that dog barking, that guy in the next cubical that has to yell into his phone, or that guy that has to smack his lips when he's chewing gum. Sometimes its just enough to put them on, flip the power switch and relax, without actually hooking them up to listen to something. I am very comfortable wearing them from 8am to 5pm, while it would be nice if my ears had a little more ventilation, but that would defeat the purpose of the noise canceling."
1851,Negative,worst investment,"Paid $300.00 for these about 5 years ago. After about 2 years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky, comes off on your fingers and gets on everything. The replacement ear pads don't fit into the frame well and come out easily. The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing. I found several over-the-ear clip ear phones for under $10.00 to be superior in every way, including comfort, quality stereo, and I can use these cheaper ear phones when I'm sweating/exercising: don't try that with the Bose headphones! The Bose headphones didn't really cancel ambient noise. I don't use them anymore."
1852,Negative,"Excellent Audio, Poor Physical Construction","I've owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate. The sound quality is excellent, as is the noise canceling. I used these in an office cubicle environment and later in a computer room, and the performance on my iPod is outstanding. But at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties, and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through. Granted, I use them almost every day, but they don't see rough use - and this isn't the type of endurance I'd expect from a $300 product. The two year warranty isn't long enough to address these issues.UPDATED JANUARY 2009One of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off. When I contacted Boise they did offer to replace them with a new set for $100."
1853,Positive,Only one problem with the backgammon set,"I purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition. The only problem I had was the black pieces. They were somehow discolored on every one. This problem was not present on the white. Everytime I play it the black pieces bother me. I would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces. I feel that I should not have to pay since this set was not cheap. Please advise.Thanks,Gary H."
1854,Negative,hmmm...,"Would I recommend it? Yes, but try to get it used. Also I would definitely buy their next in hopes that they may ""find themselves"" with a more well defined sound. You catch a bit of a sense that they are trying to be the Beastie Boys on another level... they need to just try to be Quarashi but they clearly aren't entirely sure who that is. The first track is by far the best on the album in my opinion, it absolutely rocks but the rest of it doesn't have the teeth that track does. If you like this first track don't buy the whole album for it, the entire album is only 41 minutes."
1855,Positive,I think you should read this.,"I think it was a very good book, especially if you are interested in Indian crafts or building a bow and arrow."
1856,Positive,I own this - so should you...,I'm a professional chef and a big fan of German knives. I like a heavier knife in my hand that I know will do the job all day long that I want it to. This set is amazing and I use it every day. Granted; I have swapped out a few of the garnish instruments for what I prefer to use (hate the zester and the peeler). Turned heads when I first brought it out at work but everyone wants to borrow my knives now due to their superior quality and sharpness. I wanted something other than a tired out knife roll that everyone has and have not regretted a single second of owning this item.
1857,Positive,Elli: Coming of Age in the Holocaust,"If you are ready for a stark, unrelenting description of life in the ghetto, Auschwitz and Dachau, this book doesn't let up for one sentence. Amazing story and written in a way that is poetic but easy to read. The book is classified as fiction but it is really a memoir, with names changed. There is no way anyone could make this up."
1858,Negative,"TYPOS, TYPOS, TYPOS!","I'm OK with paying for eBooks. I bought this one, but was so distracted by multiple scan-induced typographical artifacts that I requested (and received) a refund about two-thirds of the way through the book. Free eBooks force me to tolerate some typos, as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit. But, an $8 Kindle Book sold by Amazon should be free of such nuisances. This one wasn't, and I'm basing this review solely on the poor quality of the eBook itself, not the content or theme of this book. It's a shame to hype the Kindle format while simultaneously selling a sub-standard version of that very format!"
1859,Negative,I didn't think it was that great.,"Maybe it was because I didn't know the story of Cupid and Psyche before I read the book- but I was not overly moved by this book. I especially did not enjoy Part II, when I just kept wondering, what the heck is going on??? Thank goodness that Lewis included the summary of the traditional myth at the end- it might be helpful to read this part first."
1860,Negative,Don't bother!,"I love this group's early feel-good canadian rock n' roll, but I stumbled onto this album in a music store in the mall. With excitement, I sampled all the songs and to my disappointment, I still can't figure out what the hit was suppose to be. It's really terrible so don't bother. Just stick to their old stuff. Their 80's stuff rocks!!"
1861,Positive,Great for a laugh,"If you appreciate the finer aspects of life in rural Southern states, you need to buy this DVD for a good laugh;"
1862,Negative,Did we see the same movie?,"I couldn't wait to see this movie because of so many good reviews. But .... Without having read the reviews or other synopsis', I wouldn't have had a clue what was happening in the movie. There were so many flashbacks in the middle of scenes you never knew where you were. I like Christian Bale,but his fine acting was lost in the fancy editing. And as for Katie Holmes, her acting was like a piece of cardboard. Thank goodness someone loaned me the movie and I didn't have to pay for it. What a disappointment. Sorry, because I know the other reviews are great, but you must have been watching another movie."
1863,Positive,Batman Scores A Win,"Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne and the rest of the crew(Liam Neeson,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Morgan Freeman) make this film the best Batman movie yet.The director takes a different course than previous films,Batman Begins is dark and sinister.We see why Bruce Wayne turned to crime fighting.The film is chock full of suspense,action and high tech gadgets.The HD DVD version is a flawless transfer and a worthy addition to your collection."
1864,Positive,Best Batman Series!!! Great Beginning!,Best Batman Series!!! This is a great start to a fantastic story line! This gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the Dark Knight!! A must see film and must see series!
1865,Negative,Review Style comment,"If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see. We start at Bruce Wayne's beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the Dark Knight.The script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the ""Batman"" movies before it. Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman. Micheal Caine, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman played their characters with the great skill that we've come to expect from these legendary actors. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Dr. Jonathan Crane was amazing and complex. I look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series."
1866,Positive,Batman Begins Blu-ray,"Muy buena adquisición, el producto llegó a mi oficina 4 días antes de lo estimado, en excelente estado. Sin duda compraría de nuevo."
1867,Positive,A New Batman,I have all the Batman Series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back. I wanted the new take on the character. The movie doesn't disappoint. It goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character. The cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film. This is a more serious Batman than some of the other incarntions. The action is fast and cast is great. I will enjoy this movie over and over.
1868,Negative,no batmobile!!!!,-1. it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoying2.there was a classic batman bad guy3.no batmobile+the plot was good except the 1st half and the special were good could have been a lot better
1869,Positive,The Best Batman,"As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter), I think that this Batman movie is the best of the lot. While all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of Batman so much better then the others. You get to see Bruce Wayne before Batman and really see that Batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place. Now, that I've got that out of my system let me just say that Christian Bale was great. The whole movie had fantastic casting. Katie Holmes wasn't very believable as a strong district atorney and really didn't hold up that well against Bale on the screen. I believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is Batman will love it too."
1870,Positive,title for my review.,"I rented this movie because i was catching up on the trilogy preparing for DARK KNIGHT RISES!!! This movie was awesome, was really sets up for the next movies. Along with the other two, this movie is a must. Plus because i didnt own the dvd, Amazon was a fantastic alterative, with superb streaming quality!"
1871,Positive,may be a bit overrated,"I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but it may be a touch overrated. Adequate if not good performances by all members of the cast, especially Christian Bale, who comes across as interesting, charismatic, and likeable. The imagery may have been a bit run of the mill compared to a Tim Burton rendering. Nonetheless, the Batman franchise seems to still be alive and well with this latest edition. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."
1872,Positive,"Cool movie but NOT ""THE BEST EVER""","I know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently. I did too. We're charged up but don't get out of control. Get a Bat-grip on yourself. The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones,while not being superb, still have their moments.The Batsuit did make Bale look sometimes like FATman. The Batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough. I like the action sequences and how the story circled on fear. The early training stuff seemed to go a little too fast.All in all, Batman Begins is a good movie. I just think people need to think twice before they label Bale better than Keaton. HEEEELLL NOO!!! :O"
1873,Positive,batman begins,"batman begins is the best movie of 2005!christine bale stares in this movie and hedid a wonderful job doing it!this movie is about how bruce wayne turns to batman.he trains to be a ninja in asia and then founds that gotham city is flooded over with crimanels.so bruce wayne has to turn into batman to kill his very first villan, the scarcrow who could destroy poeples minds into panik!this movie is awsome!"
1874,Positive,Very Good,Very entertaining. Good quality Blu-Ray for the theatrical version. HAve not yet explored the special features.
1875,Negative,I'm not sure why this movie got good reviews,"I'm not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews. It was not good. The dialog was awful, the plot ridiculous (we have to destroy it in order to save it). I wish Liam would stop taking on mentor roles.The final scene was physically impossible (swinging under the train as it was moving. just ask yourself how he swung past the pylons that held the rail up)"
1876,Positive,Best Batman movie until Dark Knight came out.,"Batman Begins was such a relief for Batman fans. Finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction. This one is definitely the 2nd best Batman movie to date.. and I say that because The Dark Knight was just so damn good. Even if you're not a ""superhero"" movie fan, you'll like this one. This takes away the ""supernatural/superhero"" aspects of other comic movies, and turns it more realistic. Highly Recommend."
1877,Negative,It's below average.,"It contains a lot of action. However, it does not appeal to me. The acting is not engaging. I don't feel related to the plot. I prefer Spiderman 2."
1878,Positive,a good batman in long time,"i saw this movie this past summer it,s a good movie it,s better than other two batman movies batman forever and batman and robin. this movie got something right as far the comic goes theJoker did n,t kill bruce pranets keaton did a better job as batman mr bale played a good batman this movie. Has Minor actor in it a good saga review 7/10"
1879,Negative,"This movie was never that good.,",I also do not know why they bothered with this limited edition gift set. The extra disk does nothing except waste your time.
1880,Positive,Batman Begins,It was a gift for my nephew for Christmas. It came in great shape and even included a comic book!
1881,Positive,"It has been said before but bears repeating, Best Batman Yet!","Christan Bale as a young Bruce Wayne/Batman is a much needed reinvention of the Batman movie franchise. He has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the Dark Knight. I was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his own.The story is tight and easy to follow. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the parts filmed in Iceland. Big sweeping shots of snow covered mountains and raggedy buildings lining the slopes. Just fabulous.The 2 disc DVD set is spectacular. The video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid Batman fan. The compilation comic book is a very nice addition. I would recommend this set to anybody."
1882,Negative,Would Not Recommend this Toy,"My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it, I was seriously disappointed with the functionality of the click bricks.First, the click bricks don't 'stick' together well. If you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart -- very frustrating for a 2 year old!! I think the magnets are way too weak. Some of the magnets don't work at all!Second, you can't really build much of anything with the pieces in this set. They have some neat pictures of built projects on the box, but good luck recreating them!I would absolutely not recommend this toy. My son has MUCH more fun playing with his Mega Blocks and with his basic wooden alphabet blocks. Hope this review is helpful to you!"
1883,Negative,"Sounds like a good idea, but....","I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. I had bought some of the ""trucks"" and wanted him to have Bob and Wendy too. I found this set and thought it would be great. They ONLY good thing about this set is that he has Bob and Wendy.The clicking blocks sound like a great concept, but they don't work. If you can get them to click you are lucky. You can not build anything with this set. The box shows a house, buildings, etc., but you can't build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavy!I would avoid this set unless you just really need Bob and Wendy (like us)."
1884,Negative,Could be better,"I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving."
1885,Negative,Disappointing,"Firstly, I found this cream to have an odd smell to it. Secondly, it moisturizes well but not as well as I had anticipated and hoped.This product was disappointing and I do not plan on repurchasing. There are other products from NeoStrata that I love but this definitely is not one of them!"
1886,Positive,Crystal clear production and interesting arrangements.,"I really like this album and I think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe. I think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early Christian movement.Musically, the horror film samples work well next to the distorted vocals. The synths sound fantastic and the percussion has a nice amount of grainy distortion added so that the tracks are rarely boring, if at all - they pound, scream and soar through the average sonic boundary.I agree with Virus mag's review in that this album is not the most original thing out there, but the concept of the album is interesting and keeps it all pieced together. There's nothing bad about this album per se, but nothing really grabs my attention as being too exciting in terms of originality.Nevertheless, a good album for fans of dark electro/industrial/terror EBM."
1887,Positive,Athletic Director,GoFit Vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together. We use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball. It still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back. Highly recommend!!
1888,Positive,Weighted walking vest,"I really like this product..i've been using it for walking the bridges and the parks and have just started using it for jogging...and i have seen results already...it's funny too when you take it off it feels like you instantly lost 10 lbs...the only thing is that its kinda bulky so you really can't wear it under clothes, you just have to grin and WEAR it...at first i felt silly but, who cares i'm doing this for me and i feel better already!!"
1889,Positive,GoFit 10 lb walking vest,"This was a really good investment. I use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and I walk/jog/run with it on. The only negative is that you can't wear it on the outside of your clothing, because it looks like a bulletproof vest and then there are a lot of eyes staring at you. So, I decided to wear it under my clothing, it is a little bulky but it isn't so bad. I highly recommend it for someone who is new to to the vest. It is economical and it will serve the purpose of helping toGoFit 10-Pound Walking Vest with Removable Water Bottle Holdershed those pounds."
1890,Positive,GoFit walking vest,"This vest was just as described and the fit was great. It has wide shoulders so the comfort is good. Since I had never used a walking vest, I wanted to start out as recommended with lighter than 10 pounds so removed some of the weights. These were not so easy to get out of the pouches but that means they are securely held in place. I am well pleased with this GoFit walking vest."
1891,Positive,Pretty,These are very pretty but I did not use them on my tree since they look more hot pink than red. In a few years as I add more colors to my tree I will have them.
1892,Positive,Hard To Heat,I love Bodysense products.They stay hot for a long time. I use them in my massage practice as hot packs. The smell is great and it lasts quite awhile. The only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it. I wind up folding it then it stops roatating so I have to stop and adjust it. UGH it is a pain. Haven't figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly. Otherwise I love it.
1893,Positive,Great product.,"I was hesitant to buy this for my new MacBook Pro, but I'm glad I did. I took a little getting used to, but it fits very well over the keys with minimal typing interference. It's not completely transparent so it does cloud the key symbols a little bit, but not enough to make them unreadable in normal light or when the backlighting is on. I don't have any problems with it sticking to the screen (I have the regular, not glossy screen) when the cover is closed. This is cheap insurance for your computer. Liquid spills into the keyboard of a laptop computer are a disaster. The repair will be very expensive and will not be covered under warranty."
1894,Positive,great save for my Mac from my toddler !,"This little slipcover for my keyboard has saved the day for our family! I feel safe leaving my 3 year old alone with his drinks watching my laptop now that he understands to keep the keyboard protector on. Really frees me up and helps me not worry about him ruining my computer so much anymore. It would be even better if the edges were sticky enough to hold the cover on more securely, but as is gives me much peace of mind. I think everyone should have one of these!"
1895,Positive,"Chirstian ""Death"" Metal","Yes my friends of this great indstry, this is one of theworld's finest albums of the decade 1990. For so long metalhas been classified in a devilish class of its own. But to bringlight in this world of maddness, this group does indeed bring""spiritual healing"" in there heavenly ""dark"" sound! this groupdoes not exist anymore, so anything that you buy of this bandis a collector's piece! Don't delay on the purchase of this foryou will miss out on a treat. If you are in to dark and evilsounds, but do go to church, you need to get this gift fromGOD, for this is your album filled with the truth. If you arethe other guy, still don't miss out on some good music!!Big Nutt"
1896,Positive,Excellent Value,"Got these to put in my camper, great for a low watt system. I am surprised at the bass response in these little speakers. I wouldn't put them in a high power system (they are rated at 75 watt) but for a low watt system they sound very good and look great too."
1897,Negative,STRUGGLE OF WOMEN,"I was disappointed in this book. I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills. Although the book was long, it was shallow and I expected a deeper plot."
1898,Positive,Charms for the Easy Life,"gibbons weaves a compelling, influencial novel about three generations of women and the lives they lived and their impact on one another. detailed first person through Margaret birch's eye, this story tells of margarget's coming of age during world war 2. the book tells of margaret's mother (who constantly strives to be young and stylish and concequently is quite irresponsible)and her grandmother (a self-proclaimed doctor who always seems to have the right answer as well as unconditoinal love for her grand daughter) with whom she lives. in a dramatic ending, margaret realized that she has to move on from her sheltered home-life and must learn to face the world on her own two feet."
1899,Positive,The best feel-good look at life I've read!,"I couldn't help comparing this novel to The Book of Ruth. Like Ruth, it is an intriguing look at the life of a girl growing up, and the influence of family members on this growth. But, unlike Ruth, this book is positive. This book is uplifting. This book is a joy to read. This book is about intelligence, wit and love. This is a book I'd like to write! Pick this one up-then pass it along"
1900,Positive,Dean -- Send me your address,"Dean -- Love the book -- especially the pictures of Gavin and me -- but you know that. To anyone else who reads this: Dean knows whereof he speaks: He's a good hiker and builds a good, environmentally sensitive campfire. Hope you don't mind my using this avenue to try to get your e-mail address."
1901,Negative,No happy ending here--be warned!!,"****MAJOR SPOILER****DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW****Before I invested time watching this, I wish I had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end. I wouldn't have bothered, it wasn't that good anyway. Maybe this review will save someone. Giving it 2 stars because I've seen abyssal films that only deserve 1-star, and this is not that bad."
1902,Positive,probably the best movie ever,"this was a random movie I picked out on Netflix to watch and I am so glad I did. I laughed, I cried, I know it sounds cliche, but what an amazing love story. Such a great message."
1903,Positive,Loved,"I caught this movie today on LMN, when I was channel surfing. Unfortunately I missed the first 25 minutes. I tried not to let Kent Moran distract me from the plot, but he's gorgeous. He's a screenwriter, musician and actor huh? Not just a pretty face. Anyways, back to the movie... It was a movie about real people, that I could relate to. I'm buying this so I can see what I missed."
1904,Positive,'Listen To Your Heart' -- directed by Matt Thompson,"Great movie filmed in New York, directed by Matt Thompson and written by Kent Moran. Scenes were filmed with the 'Red Cam' so it feels like you're right there with the actors. It's a great story about a high society deaf girl (controlled by her mother) and an ordinary 'Joe' (who works for a living) who fall in love. His dream is music and so is hers, even though she can't hear. Make sure to have your tissue ready for it will tug at your heart and the tears will come.It has won many awards in the film festivals throughout the US, one which was 'Best Director' at the Beverly Hills Film Festival.It's another Love Story movie worth watching."
1905,Positive,An OK Book,"This is an ok book. It is action packed and holds your attention. I think that the main charecter, Dick Shelton, is a lot like many people today even though the book takes place in Medieval times. Dick did not know that he was fighting for his enemy Sir Daniel, the man who had killed his father. I think this is one of the best historical fiction books that I have ever read. I hope that you will like it as much as I did."
1906,Negative,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST,"When comparing Stevenson's major works, this book just doesn't compare. It's wooden, stilted and written in the voice of Northern UK's speech."
1907,Positive,Transitions,"I am an avid fan of DM, and will do the best job at being objective about their work. Although, I think this album is great and it has many quintessential DM songs, there are some songs that I often skip over. These songs are definitely not my favorites, but I think mostly that they just don't appeal to me in the context of this album. This is why I label this ""transitions"". I love all periods of DM, but I notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier ""new wave"" feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of DM. I tend to prefer the darker DM, but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously. If you are even a slight fan of their work, you will enjoy this album."
1908,Negative,trash,This cd blows nothing worth listening to. Really sucks the big unit. One of there worst cds.thank you very muchyour welcome
1909,Negative,Unhappy....Constantly Turns Off,"Very disappointed with this amp. It has an auto shut off, which is a cool feature. However it randomly shuts off while in use. VERY frustrating."
1910,Positive,Simple Amp,This amp does what it is supposed to do. Only thing I wasn't aware of was that the AB speaker switches don't allow output to go to both speakers at the same time. Maybe this was in the write up but if so I missed it.
1911,Negative,Too noisy,An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers. The noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as I turn up the volume knob.
1912,Positive,Just what I was looking for....,Great AMP for the speakers in my garage and Lanai.....Sounds great and easy to useSimple is good...plus the price is right!
1913,Positive,Works very well,"I have a whole-house sound entertainment system, which includes a pair of speakers in the dining room, a pair of speakers in the living room, and a pair of speakers in the bedroom. I have a AirportExpress connected directly to this unit, and it has no problem powering all six pairs of in-ceiling speakers. In fact, this unit is so powerful, I cannot turn the volume up beyond the midpoint because I fear that my windows will break. An excellent product for the price.Note: This unit has a single RCA output, so make sure you use a splitter if you intend to connect multiple pairs of speakers to this amplifier."
1914,Negative,"Horrible Audio, No Teaching","These other reviewers are kidding you.There are significant problems with this dvd.1. The audio on this dvd is horrible. It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube. I could have done better in my garage.2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin. There is no teaching whatsoever.I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this."
1915,Negative,Not good unless you have a good knowledge of math,"I'm not a math cripple but I will admit that I have not always been that great when it comes to math. I have recently grown a hunger for science in general, ( including mathematics of course) and thought I should look for a book to help me grasp math from another perspective. I actually read many of the pages in the book and while I did understand the first couple pages , I found myself lost as I continue reading. As another reviewer mentioned , this is not a book for the layman. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math. I guess I'll just keep looking elsewhere to find books on the subject that will help me on my journey to become better at math."
1916,Negative,low budget cheap 90's film of pregnancy,"3 or 4 college buds all court the same row captain and then she becomes pregnant///focuses all around the bar and their goofiness...when word comes out she has a kid, they all rush, not knowing who is the dad and they all step up - but it is pretty playful and not realistic."
1917,Positive,Great Shorts for work or play,"I have bought about 6 pairs of this short. They are very confortable and wear very well. I'm pretty hard on them because I wear them for work. The hold up very well, good purchase."
1918,Positive,A compelling Biblical story,This Biblical fiction is a great introduction to the story of King Hezekiah. The characters have depth and I am eager to read the next book in the series.
1919,Positive,Gods and Kings,Chronicles of the Kings # was a great introduction to the series. I gained a different insight into the History
1920,Negative,God's and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1,This was a great book to read. I had a hard time putting it down! Can not wait to read the next one!
1921,Positive,History in action,I love history - especially Biblical history and this book uses the information in the Bible and then builds on that information with researched information to make it come alive. It seemed like a long book at the start but it ended too soon.
1922,Positive,It send be back to the Word,Loved the connection not only with history and the Bible but also with Lynn's interpretation of the characters. Made me want to seek out the Word in the Kings and Chronicles. Anything that leads us to the Lord has to be great.
1923,Negative,Did Nothing,I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
1924,Negative,did nothing,"I got the tea fast, and followed the instructions, only drinking 1/2 cup, which had no effect on my system, it taste pretty good though."
1925,Positive,Cossotto and Kraus are Favorites,"Sometimes one forgets the great singers of but a few years ago. This 1971 performance recording, made in Tokyo, though visually a bit dark, is acoustically sparkling with the singers' joy with Donizetti's music. He would surely loudly applaud this effort. Both Fiorenza Cossotto and Alfredo Kraus are at their peak. To say nothing of Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi in supporting roles. This opera, unfortunately, is often overlooked for the better known Donizetti works. Well worth enjoying as the music is grand, the arias are among his finest and the ballet a treat to see."
1926,Negative,Just Plain Awful,"The first and second Robocop films were great. I loved the over-the-top action and humor elements in both films.Robocop 3 is a pure, unadulterated disaster. First off, it is way too tame (a PG-13 rating??!!). Second, the ""plot"" is completely ruined by the introduction of the ""cute little kid who is a computer whiz"" character, what a travesty! Third, the movie is actually boring; a boring Robocop movie! I could go on and on, but why bother.They dare to put this garbage on DVD?"
1927,Negative,Junk,"When a movie has dialogue like, ""I thought your ninja was supposed to take care of RoboCop!"", it ain't gonna be Citizen Kane. It won't even be a good RoboCop movie. But if you must indulge, look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies. Yes, I said look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies."
1928,Positive,"Excellent Stories, So-So Analysis","I enjoyed all but one of the 11 stories in this book from 1927 to 2002. Even though I didn't enjoy Pamela Zoline's ""The Heat Death of the Universe"" I can see why it is an important story to include in this collection of some of the science fiction that can be seen as feminist. ""seen as feminist"" here is the key I think especially when you look at the essays paired with each story. A few of the essays were spot on -- looked at the author and the story in their historical context. Others rambled between sharing previous scholarship and trying to find multiple readings of the material one of which was a feminist interpretation. The 11 stories are intense and moving, challenging the reader while entertaining. I loved that they were organized chronologically because I could see a flow and development of the feminist voice. I wish a concluding essay had tied them all together to bring this out more."
1929,Negative,POOR ATTEMPT FOR A ROCK ALBUM,"EVERYTHING ABOUT ALBUM MAKES ME WANNA GRAB A GUN AND SHOOT MYSELF. THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS. IT'S LACKS EMOTION, AND IT SOUNDS FORCED. LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO HARD TO SPREAD THE WORD INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE GOOD MUSIC. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS SO GENERIC, SO DULL, SO PREDICTABLE. ONLY A MORON WOULD THINK THIS IS A WORTH WHILE CD TO LISTEN TOO."
1930,Positive,I'm mesmerized!,"This book is so mesmerizing! Try ""Perla at the Mexican Border..."" (p. 41):Her job was to sort through the eyes/ of dolls. Snapping hollow limbs/ into plastic torsos had been a soothing task/ for Perla, like arranging the peas into the pod/Beautiful imagery in very simple moments. Gonzalez doesn't take anything for granted. Small moments become big ones. This is exemplary poetry. I recommend this to everyone I know!!! The NPS made a great choice!"
1931,Positive,The Train Delivers!,"Originally I purchased this book because my Granddaughter's name is Sophia and I know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name. But I would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book. The pictures are bright and bold, the text right at the level of a preschooler AND it opens up to display a long train! A fun book to read together!"
1932,Negative,"ohh god, its those Troma freaks again!","I must say that, even for Troma, this one was pretty bad. A plane crash leaves tourists stranded on a tropical island that happens to be the home base of a group of nasty terrorists. Now, think Troma: how would YOU work with this plot? Needless to say, there are MANY dead before it ends. I thought there was a limit to the amount of blood and guts one could put into a movie (and smear on a woman's breasts) untill I saw ""War"". The movie is rather low quality, not like some of the newer Troma releases, but if you like classic Troma, it dosn't get any more classic than this. Not one for the kiddies!"
1933,Positive,recommended for all beginners,"There is a little detective in all of us, but in most cases one wouldn't know where to begin. If you are curious about possible existence of paranormal phenomenon this book gives you that place to start. Whether a skeptic,a believer,this book gives the information needed to begin simple investigations in a manner that is easy to understand. For someone who hasn't had years of experience in the paranormal, or criminal investigation some of the books available can be intimidating. Mr Southalls book however makes you feel that doing your own investigation is within abilities. This book is not perfect, but it give an excellent starting point for the novice to begin investigating from."
1934,Negative,"It's OK, in places poorly written","A very basic book, seems to be a promotional tool for certain tours, if this type of book is your first read it will serve a purpose."
1935,Positive,The best heart and key pendant set ever!!!!!!!,"Absolutely one of the most beautiful little necklaces around. Get it and you will get lots of compliments on how nice it is. I was so happy that I purchased it.I had been looking for over three years for the perfect heart and key set, and this is it. Very nice weight and size and very expensive looking.Trust me if you get it or give it, you'll be pleased."
1936,Negative,Impossible to read,The print is so incredibly small that I couldn't even finish reading it (I am in my early 30's with perfect vision and do not use glasses). Seemed like a cute story if only the format was better.
1937,Positive,Superb seller and wonderful product,"Date: 11/28/2008 (I bought this for Christmas 2008)My brother-in-law had wanted a Clint Eastwood Poncho for a long time but the ones I saw were pretty expensive. Then I saw this one on Amazon. Not only was the price right, but the look and quality are great! The seller notified me immediately that the item was on backorder, but it ended up arriving sooner than expected. Superb seller and wonderful product!"
1938,Positive,Everyday Creative: 30 Ways to Wake Up Your Inner Artist,I really liked the cards. I teach a class in creativity and I was able to give them to individual students to encourage their creative growth.
1939,Negative,Distasteful dystopia.,"Tittle the ""ethicist"" (more like elitist) puts her faith in Eugenics. Welcome to Nazi Germany for the 21st century.She proposes the development of a contraceptive vaccination universally administered to children at puberty, the antidote only given following an individual's licensing by the government. Now logically, the inevitable illegal pregnancies would have to be halted by abortion. Forced government abortions. China, anyone? Or at the very least, ripping babies from the arms of ""unsuitable"" mothers and awarding them to more correct ones. Fascist Argentina in the 1970s?Wonder why so many copies of her book are available for sale used? Hmmm. Remainder table. Should have aborted the book."
1940,Positive,Not So Scary Anymore,"I remember being about 10 or 11 years old and being frightened out of my mind by the scary Bjork lady dancing around on a truck on MTV. Sufficet to say, I couldn't understand why she was getting rave reviews. A coupla years later I saw her on Jay Leno singing a big-band song and loved it. The screaming was a little odd for me, but I recanted and bought the single to ""It's Oh So Quiet."" Can you say, ""Excellent""? I immediately went out and purchased this CD, ""Post"" and was blown away at how awesome it is! There are so many good songs on here, it is definitley a CD everyone should own. Don't miss it! And by the way, Bjork being scary just makes her oh so much more appealing, wouldn't you say?"
1941,Negative,Not a true CD Audio or DVD Audio Disc,I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only. Disappointing. I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.
1942,Negative,Missing most of the play!,"This version of the play is MISSING Acts III and IV.Act IV, Scene ii contains some of the most famous lines of Shakespeare: ""Fear no more the heat of the sun ..."" So, if you need this play, are crunched for time, and need it to supplement a research paper on stream-of-consciousness and Mrs. Dalloway ... I would definitely GET ANOTHER VERSION!Thanks a lot for the complete rip off."
1943,Negative,duplicate dvd,This is the same dvd that I had previously purchased with a different cover. I will keep it because I like the workout and the previous dvd skips in places.
1944,Positive,Different,"This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs, much more digital than the pervious album. his vice is possibly better in this cd, definatly worth the ep price"
1945,Negative,Do not buy,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
1946,Negative,Boring Book,"I picked this book up thinking it would be good (yes, I judge books by the covers). It was awful...I am not sure why I even kept reading it all the way through. There is no action or anything. He and his brother are poor, his brother gets girls (he doesn't)...boring..boring. I don't even know what the author was trying to communicate with the audience. If you don't want to waste your time, don't read this book."
1947,Positive,"Not too powerful, but pretty fun to shoot.","If you want to shoot bbs at your room mate indoors, this is definitely the way to go. Has a ridiculous rate of fire, which is faster than the Pulse M74, but it is also weaker than the Pulse M74. The hopper doesn't hold as many bbs as it should, however (~70)."
1948,Negative,Ew!,"Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1) bland or 2) outright disgusting. I need to throw this book away before I waste more time and money on disastrous recipes.Silken Chocolate pie: NastyBlack Bean Dip: TastelessSkinny Dip: I cant believe this is considered food.One plus is that it inspired some great dishes. Since I don't eat eggs, high protein breakfasts are hard to come by. I made a tofu veggie casserole (not following the book's recipe, but rather the general concept) and it came out wonderful...but all in all this book has been a waste of money- beyond the purchase and shipping costs."
1949,Negative,not enough calories,"This looked great at first... but then I started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes. Most of the Main Dishes have less than 200 calories, some have less than 100. I don't have time to cook and eat 8-10 meals per day."
1950,Positive,Too Bad they broke up,These guys really are great. Too bad they broke up before they could really big. they're big but i mean REALLY big. I'm planning on buying this album once i'm not broke. I've litened to thier free mp3s on mp3.com and they are really good. I look forward to the purchasing of this album.
1951,Positive,A great book for everyone,I didn't think anger was a real problem for me until I got married and some things I thought to be essential needs weren't being met by my spouse. This book has shown me some powerful principles on how to understand and deal with my anger constructively rather than destructively.
1952,Negative,this is a christian based religious agenda book,It's a trick ! unless you have a religious outlook don't buy this book ! Just got it today and it sneaks in all sorts of nonsense.
1953,Negative,not a christian and can't use it in my work.,this book is for christians and i am not a christian. i cannot use this in my work as it is illegal for me to foster christian beliefs on my residential clients. i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based. i feel ripped off.
1954,Positive,Ahhhhhhhh!,"This back brush is what I have been looking for for a long time. others I have tried were too soft or were of sponge material that deteriorated quickly or fell off the handle. This one is a good, stiff, scrubbing brush that can get to all those places on my back that I cannot reach.I recommend this to anyone who wants to feel clean and scrubbed."
1955,Negative,Big Minus,This item is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
1956,Negative,Bloody Awful,I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character. I wanted to take Frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.
1957,Negative,Typical rightwing garbage,"The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the ""Just say no"" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack."
1958,Positive,Preparing for adolescence,It was so true! And definitely helpful. Teenagers will find encouragement because someone took the time to explain all those confusing changes they go through.
1959,Positive,Rational Anti-mysticism: Healthy debunking,"Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view, even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life-saving. This book offers a critique of the Sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self-deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one's views than to seek fantastical delusions. Now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one's mysticism one should give such nay-sayers a careful hearing, concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view. Otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk."
1960,Positive,"Scholarly, critical analysis of Islamic religion & history.","Rawandi contends that reliable sources undermine the classical account of Islam and Sufism, and his study seeks to rectify this imbalance through studying the philosophy of religion and traditionalists to provide a new, critical analysis of Islam. Readers already well versed in Islamic religion and history will find this a scholarly, detailed probe."
1961,Negative,Utter drivel,"What a piece of derivative garbage. 311 already made this album and made it better years ago. Give up now and focus on the homework, kids. This music is taking to straight to the unemployment line."
1962,Negative,I was expecting different,The music is too loud for me but I will send to to friend like that type of stuff
1963,Positive,LOVE IT!,"This is an amazing little pot. It brews fast, no leaking and the coffee tastes great!! I have been using it for 3 months now and no problems so I got my mom one and she loves it!! Great for those days when you only want a little coffee."
1964,Negative,It's heat plate grows rusty within few month.,"Two years ago, I brought it and like it. I drink coffee in the morning, so only used it only once a day. Few month after I brought it, its heat plate started growing rusty. I continuely used it for additional six month when the 50% heat plate was rusted. I thought it was an incidence, so I threw it away and brought the same model again. Nine month late, 20% heat plate is rusted.... This time I don't think it is a incidence again."
1965,Positive,Ionic Breeze Review,"I bought this product for the girlfriend, who happens to be be a smoker. Her car always smelled really bad, abviously. I purchased this to try and curb the smell and surprisingly, despite the small size of this product it works very well. Keeps the car smelling fresh even after being smoked in."
1966,Positive,Funny and smart,"These guys are really a good match together. So funny and fun to watch with the family. I wish it had the Thin man, which for some reason I thought this had. But I ended up getting the Thin man collection later anyways."
1967,Positive,I know I'm biased but..........,"This is a beautifully presented box set of Powell & Loy which gives youan insight to films they made together other than the ""Thin Man"" seriesthe clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me consideringthe films age.As for the actors I would buy a film of Powell and Loy shopping inWal-Mart i'm that easily pleased, but if you want to see the golden ageof Hollywood and a mixture of drama and screwball comedy at its bestthen look no further"
1968,Negative,"Run, Do Not Hide","While this book didn't scare me, I found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twin-carrying women who like and trust their obgyns, believe that pain is generally to be avoided, and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist. Also, I found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mother's doubts about carrying twins. Gee, what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother..."
1969,Negative,depressing and scary,"I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, ""when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk,"" and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book."
1970,Negative,Disappointing romance,Writer uses the war as filler while trying to pass off child molesting as romance. Couple doesn't get together until the end of the book. Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history.
1971,Positive,Ideal Weight,"After having numerous store-bought scales, always thinking, Geez, I don't weigh that much or WOW,I lost a few,only to find out the scale was the culprit. The adjusting wheel would only ""Zero"" the dial, and not correct the problem. The Detecto ""physicians scale""Detecto 437 Balance Beam Doctor/Physician Scale, 400 lbs, Made in the USAis just what I was looking for. After an easy assembly and adjustment I checked the accuracy by putting various weights on the platform, from 25#s to 250#s and it was ""right on"". I wish I would have bought this sooner, and it's ""Made in the USA"" !!!!"
1972,Positive,Dennis back on form,"Passion Street is a cracking single from former Dr Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere. The close harmony backing vocals & Dennis's spoken intro instantly remind you of the ""old band"" while retaining a fresh, crisp sound. Well wort checking out (as is the album)."
1973,Negative,Disco Queen,"Queen loved to experiment. Every time they released a new song, I would hear it and say (in delight), ""Is that Queen?"" However, this album abandoned all that was Rock and Roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music. The only bright spot from this album was ""Under Pressure."" Thankfully, they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
1974,Positive,"A colorful and vivid album, just like the&#65279; 80s ! !","Queen played in 1982 with new sounds; The result was an entertaining record, however much called die hard fans criticized it."
1975,Positive,Wonderful Collection,"I had enough of a balance on a gift card for one CD. After listening to samples of selections from Liona Boyd, Ana Vidovic, Susan Isbin and Martha Masters, I came across this one. I listed to the samples over and over and finally ordered it, largely because I liked the sounds of the duet. Once I received the CD and played the selections all the way through, I think I made the right choice. This is a superb collection. These two ladies brilliantly blend melodies and harmonies, with a little dissonance thrown in here and there.I've had it for a few months now and it's still as fresh as when I first listened to it. You know sometimes when you get a new CD, you're hyped up on it and listen to it over and over, but then after a while it takes its place amongst the rest of your collection? Not this one for me. Whenever I need to wind down, this is the one I listen to and I haven't grown tired of it yet."
1976,Positive,Wires and Wood,Saw them at an outdoor concert and they were great. This is a good cd even if you do not care that much for bluegrass you will like this.
1977,Positive,good stuff,"As a huge fan of Buffy-only the original novels, though, this whole 'series' was actually pretty good. I may still like the gatekeepers trilogy better, but hey, each of these 4 books were only 2.99 or so, and they don't take long to read. Worth a look ."
1978,Negative,what a waste,"My poor son was so eager to play with this toy after receiving it for his birthday. But he was quickly disappointed. The tank was too heavy when filled with water and the straps would not adjust enough to fit on him (we had to rig the straps). The tube would come out of the tank when i tried to pump the tank. Which I had to pump repeatedly. Was not a toy that he could play with on his own, someone had to be present to constantly pump it. Was just as disappointed with another spiderman blaster. They need to change the age range on these toys to 18 and up!"
1979,Negative,I don't think nephew ever played with it.,I don't remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toy.I'm sure I didn't pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didn't last too long after the initial opening on Christmas eve.
1980,Negative,Really needs an AC adapter,"See the reviews for the AUA-1422 - a similar item with one extra 1394 port. Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V, 2.1A), and used to offer one that fit them through their store, but apparently no longer do! Without the adapter, this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the USB or 1394 connection - which is a shame, because the Adaptec 1394 implementation was always the most stable on my machines. Look for one that includes an AC adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead."
1981,Positive,Better than I remember,"Grab a teen and watch it with them if you've got one around.Saw it awhile ago, wasn't that impressed. Teenaged Daughter wanted to watch it, so I sat with her and enjoyed it more this time.Thought provoking, and a conversation starter."
1982,Positive,Sixteen-and active,"Keir Gilchrist, an impressive kid actor of kid movies, had grown up as well as his character-a sixteen year old sex-experimenting pupil who had checked himself into psycho ward to cure from depression with a single pill only.It is surely a deep-meaningful work for viewers M15+, of a kind of such a medicine and a world in and outside the nut house screened."
1983,Positive,Sweet story,Great story of a teenager who spends a week in a mental health ward makes new friends and changes his life.
1984,Negative,"ugly lighting, poor cast, trite story","I could not finish this mess...everyone in it should be embarrassed kind of a very poor production , story and cast!"
1985,Negative,Slow Paced and Dragging,Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
1986,Negative,IZ,Fun if you have a young male child that isnt into the music... it fart and burps and makes annoying noises during the music. not the toy for me but i think little boys would find it funny (but i do see it getting old quick)
1987,Negative,Disappointing,"I give this collection of sonatas only two stars because the way they were recorded only allows two fifths of them to play on my Bose. I returned them once, received a quick replacement - the same. Most of them have to be played in the car. Also, I believe Barenboim plays some of the sonatas too fast - just because he can."
1988,Positive,"Loud fast, heavy, yet unbelievably catchy...","I first heard of these guys in a short article of Guitar World and later found this CD at a music show for pretty cheap and decided to pick it up. While the songs are very heavy complete with loud vocals, humorous lyrics, heavy fast power chords, and screaming solos, what do you expect from a 90's punk band? NP proves to the world, that they play what they want to and not what the public wants to hear. Their live shows sound very interesting complete with a fire-breathing bassist and crazy stage antics. If you like it loud and fast, give this one a try! You gotta love the cover too, heh."
1989,Positive,Excellent sauce whisk,I love this sauce whisk. It's comfortable to hold while whisking and easy to clean. I highly reccomend getting one for yourself.
1990,Positive,R. Kelly is still on top!,"R. Kelly is still on top! TP-2.com consists of 19 blazin tracks, some of my favorite tracks are Fiesta, Just Like A Real Freak, I Wish, I Wish (remix), Strip For You, Greatest Sex, Feelin on Yo Booty, I Mean, I Don't Mean it, All I Want, Just Like That The Storm is Over Now, this track is no doubt the best song on the album, this song is tight! and many other tracks are good too. If don't have this album, get out there and get it. If you don't like slow R&B don't get this but if u do I would recommend this for you. I saw R. Kelly in concert and he is awesome, he keeps droppin those platinum hits for his fans. Get this album right now! ... peace"
1991,Positive,freak come out at night,"r kelly goes back to his freaky roots on this one, if you wanna hear kelly talk about oral sex for the millionith time please get this, if you love bump-n-grind, 12 play and classic kelly then this is especially for you. fellas, ladies you better protection on this."
1992,Negative,Once again R kelly has done it.......but did we want him to.,"R kelly's carrer is full of contradictions. On one song he's singing about how good GOD is, then the next song he's Feeling on ya Boody. R kelly has so much potential to be a respectful artist. But if he continues on the corse he is now, the qualtiy of his character will continue to be decline along with his music."
1993,Positive,best r&b album of the year,I was never much of an r and b fan till i heard this album. R. Kelly is an amazing artist and this is his best work yet. There are very few album where i can listen to every song from start to finish but this is one of them. If you have any doubts about getting this album BUY IT. you wont regret it.
1994,Positive,great understanding to helping yourself,this will help you to under stand life and your own self needs and how to listen to your inter soul if you follow your owen heart. it has helped me to see thing a little different.
1995,Positive,Amazing!,"Love this book, it's the first time in my life that I am meditating daily! The exercises are great, the pace that you work through the book is excellent. Sonia really knows what she's talking about, very real and grounded, practical and useful advice. I am getting this book for a few close friends for gifts!"
1996,Positive,Phenomenal Reading Material! Lots of Fun,I'm naturally a huge fan of Jeff Corwin and his work to help nature and its inhabitants is very much needed these days. He does a wonderful job in putting you in the locale that he is in. Vivid descriptions and his natural mix of humor makes this an excellent book for any reading enthusiast. Great photos included. Definetely worth adding to your collection. You'll have lots of fun reading it!
1997,Positive,Interesting and fun read!,Jeff Corwin is an amazing man who has many adventures to share. His love for animals shines in every word he writes.
1998,Positive,Great Children's Story,The Precious Moments Stories are great.We like to keep them in our home to share with childrenthat come to visit ~ we enjoy watching them over and over again as well.
1999,Positive,Good Alertative HIstory.......,An oft time time spooky alternative history of a world where the Cuban Missile Crisis ended in war.The story of a newpaper reporter while in the process of reporting on just another murder stumbles across clues to the biggest secret known. There are those that will pay any price to keep him from unraveling the truth.
2000,Negative,Resurection Day,"How many of other readers purchased this book and got to page 277 and found the pages blank to 477? The store it was purchased at was going to just exchange it however in review of the 5 they had in stock, all had the same blank pages. The store then refunded my money. The book was great up until then."
2001,Positive,Purrfect,"These shoes are a little high price wise, but you can't beat the convenience. Right at your doorstep and back into childhood for just a few extra dollars. No brainer. Will be back for more."
2002,Positive,Really nice shoes,"These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy."
2003,Positive,red converse,Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Plaid Hi SneakerGreat shoes at a great price! My daughter loves them :)
2004,Positive,Size is off,"I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)"
2005,Negative,Not for me,"I'm accustomed to Dansko, Sanita, and Allegria shoes, which are all very comfortable, but require a break in period. I'm ok with that. But these never seemed to get broken in. Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands. I'm on my feet 9 hours a day, on concrete, walking around and up and down stairs, for several miles a day, sometimes with long periods standing (I'm an adult-education instructor). I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time, and was hoping these would be it. I wear a 10 (40) in women's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well (thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order) but they just aren't the shoe for me."
2006,Positive,awesome shoes.,"awesome shoes. what can i say. look great with pants, jeans, khakis. whatever. versatile, durable, sylish. you won't regret this purchase. maybe run a half size bigger than my size. but it's iffy."
2007,Negative,Linen Chef Jacket,"This chef coat is very, very large (I ordered a med.) if you are a ladies size 16 or larger this may fit you -- but the coat has no shaping whatsoever -- so you will look like a big marshmallow (mine is white) -- also, where the collar meets at the neck has a very large space -- which is not traditional and looks very odd. The fabric quality is OK, which for the price is not so great. Perhaps this was cut for men, but the buttons and fabric would make it too girly. This coat design needs to be amended and shaped and the overlap (where the buttons cross over) needs to be re-thought as the fabric hangs down and bunches under the coat -- so the bottom hem is not 'clean' -- it needs a button underneeth or something to stop that from happening."
2008,Positive,One of the greatest plays in English Literature,"I have read this play and also performed the part of Joan on stage many times. Shaw's play brings the soul of Joan to life. A girl with no formal education - defeated the English, won a crown for a king, and was tried and burned as a witch - dead at or under the age of 23. No wonder she was made a saint. The story would almost be a horrible fairy tale, if it wasn't true."
2009,Positive,Gorgeous music gorgeously played,"I will not usually recommend a mono CD unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative. Well, there are many recent CDs filled with ""the antique music,"" but none bear up so well as the Amadeus reissue of the 1961 <Instrumental Music of 1600> (AMD 7007) as performed by the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the man who was one of the pioneers of ""period instruments"" in recordings. Here we have 23 cuts of music from France (du Tertre, du Caurroy), England (Holborne, Morley, Tomkins, Cooper, Bevin), Germany (Sommer, Posch, Scheidt), and Italy (Cabrielli, Gumai, Massaino), all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound. I will deduct a rating-point, however, for its short running time of 46 minutes. But all in all, this is gorgeous music gorgeously played."
2010,Positive,"If you read only 1 book about the death penalty, read this!","This well-written book examines virtually all arguments regarding the death penalty. In addition to exposing current practices, Just Revenge also puts the death penalty in an historical context. Its inevitable conclusion, as it demolishes every well-cherished but incorrect justification for the death penalty (with the exception of a clause in the 5th Amendment) , is that the only thing proponents have left on their side is indeed just revenge. Mark Costanzo's own opinion is clear virtually from the start, but he backs it up with fact after devastating fact. If you want to learn more about the death penalty, this is an excellent place to begin. It is also a useful reference book as it is chock-full of statistics and anecdotes."
2011,Positive,Great but,"These caps are hard to find. Being a deputy sheriff it is a necessary item to have. I have put it to good. Use and found it to be recognizable and protective. Best yet, the price was reasonable for a quality product."
2012,Positive,good,"Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a good purchase on my part. thanks!"
2013,Negative,hate it,I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies.. and I hate it... I feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history...
2014,Negative,Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper!,Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper! It is not deep enought to fit 12X12 paper. Don't make the same mistake I did!
2015,Negative,Poor product from dishonest dealer,"Ordered two, and billed for two, as Christmas presents. Received one, which was a misassembled plastic piece of garbage. Oh well, my fault for buying jewelry over the net. Should, at least, receive what I ordered, however. So I wrote the dealer to either send the second one or issue a refund. Never could get a reply. Threw the one that had arrived in the trash. Would have given this a negative rating, if ""1"" were not the lowest number available."
2016,Negative,unseen is the word,"I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious, of course, but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book. The chronology is confused, and while the book reaches for important issues, ie the need for a young girl to have a mother, the treatment of the characters is shallow. The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous ""healing"" of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper. She is a jewel of characterization, much needed and appreciated in this novel."
2017,Negative,Definitely not Prodigy's best material,"Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this single...Baby's Got A Temper just does not catch the attention of my ears. In ways it does mimic the style of a few of Prodigy's past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines, but it just can't match the magic of their former hits like Breathe and Firestarter. The remixes of Baby's Got A Temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either. Even die-hard Prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it. Hopefully Prodigy's upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single."
2018,Positive,Great tune!,"The Prodigy are back!""Baby's Got A Temper"" is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless, dire amounts of pop-garbage.The only bad thing I have to say about this great CD isthat the other mixes don't vary too much from the originaltrack, being a dub and instrumental (respectively). I wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracks.That said, ""Baby's Got A Temper"" is such a great,catchy song, that I still enjoy the other versions and Ijust can't get enough of the tune itself anyway!:) Great video too!!Absolutely recommended!"
2019,Positive,One of the Best Metal Albums of All Time!,"The first song I heard on this album was ""Bounce,"" and to be quite honest, I wasn't impressed. But I saw the CD at Best Buy, and thought, ""Why not."" I must say it has not been something I've regretted. This is nu-metal years ahead of any other band you will find out there, with insightful underlying political protest all the way through. But if you want an album to just rock out to... well this is actually an amazing choice anyway. There is some amazing stuff here. Like ""Chop Suey!"" a deeply touching/disturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and ""Toxicity"" a song about the terrible disorder in the world. With the split of Rage Against the Machine, there is little possible competition for System on their way to the nu-metal top."
2020,Positive,Good but doesn't top the first one,"As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort, it took me a long time to get into this one. But I guess i'm like that with every new cd a band comes out with. Anyway. I think that on this cd Serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song, but I was disapointed that the drummer, did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band's self-titled debut. All in all i really enjoyed this cd and I would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into System of a down. The single ""Chop Suey!"" is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon. Although the sound of the song is a bit more radio-friendly than the rest of the cd, it is still a great song. Another song with great talent is the song ""Toxicity"" which has proven to become my favorite on this multi-faceted album."
2021,Positive,COOL,"Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good."
2022,Positive,Overall pretty good,"I'm going to make this short and sweet: it's not the greatest album in the world because I still can't listen to the whole thing straight through, but I just have to say that ""Toxicity"" is one of my most favorite songs in the world, you just can't beat the guitars in this song, and the drums are amazing! ""Chop Suey!"" is also great, it's got interesting allusions to God and Jesus, ""Psycho"" is good headbanging fun (and warns you to stay away from cocaine too!), and ""Aerials"" is nice and meaningful. Oh, and ""Bounce"" is hilarious... but I'll leave it up to you to buy the album and figure out what they're really talking about."
2023,Negative,[bad deal],Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
2024,Negative,"I may have enjoyed this album, had i been deaf!","I may have enjoyed this album, had i been 14 years old or deaf. Strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i dont like, #1 his voice is very annoying from the get go, where are they going with this garbage.Its been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metal/music that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnt,i dont think this genre will be pop much longer."
2025,Positive,Real good music.,"This CD is really , really awesome. It's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre. Quite frankly, i like every type of music, besides country, that is.(heh) This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed. rap, rock, whatever, i like it all. This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste. Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone"
2026,Positive,One of Systems Best Albums,"Along with their self titled album, these two are the best albums I have heard ever by any group."
2027,Positive,Awesome!!,This is one bad [rear] group! I have both of their albums and the only problem is that I listen to them so much that I can't get the songs out of my head.Killer lyrics and wonderful beats. You won't be disappointed.
2028,Negative,Bunch of Garbage,There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
2029,Positive,shock to the system,"Upon hearing the song Toxicity on MTV I had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem. What I didn't expect was such consistency.Initially tracks like X and Forest do not stand out as much as MTV hits Chop Suey! and Toxicity, however on further listens you will discover that it is the lesser known tracks that hold your interest and ensure this album stays in your cd player for a while. I now hope to see these guys live at some stage to see if the energy displayed on this album translates as well in live performance."
2030,Neutral,Disappointing - Not a Premium Roast,"This Thanksgiving evening, four of us tried the Starbucks Vanilla Roast. All of us were disappointed. Comments included: 'bitter', 'too acidic', 'flat', 'vanilla smell overcomes the coffee aroma'. When drinking the vanilla roast, the bitterness outweighs the coffee taste and the vanilla is all but invisible. Most coffees are average and this one is no different. It is no star when it comes to the coffee field. If you are a serious coffee connoisseur or would like to find out more about great coffee, you will be best served by investigating premium roasts available from other (often less mainstream) roasters."
2031,Neutral,Doesn't Taste Like Vanilla To Me,"If there is indeed any vanilla flavor, it's not enough for me.  It is way too subtle, at least for me.  For some reason, whenever I either order or buy Starbuck's coffee in their shop, it's always too strong for me, even when I use the same amount of coffee, or less per pot.<br /><br />All I taste is coffee that is too strong for me.  I was hoping I would like this, as I always buy flavored coffees. I liked the fact that Starbuck's is using natural vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Disappointed!"
2032,Neutral,"I like vanilla, but this is pretty intense","This is ground Starbucks Arabica coffee, which has been infused with intense vanilla flavoring.  My first impression was the aroma of the coffee upon opening the package - very nice vanilla aroma, but strong. When I made my first pot of coffee I used the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla alone.  For me, this was a mistake.  WAY too sweet, and I like vanilla flavored creamer in my coffee, but used plain half n' half for this one and it still tasted too sweet to me.<br /><br />The second pot I chose to mix this coffee (50/50) with a Kona blend from the local market.  My husband still thought the blend to be too sweet, but I liked it.  I guess the bonus here would be that if you like a more subtle, less sweet vanilla flavoring to your coffee the package will last you that much longer when you blend it with something non-flavored!<br /><br />I give it a 3-star rating because to me, it's just OK.  I can't say I like it, but I don't dislike it either.<br /><br />The packaging says 'an accent of vanilla' and 'an understated vanilla highlight'.  I'd beg to differ.  I'd say something like infused with a 'strong vanilla overtone'.  The ground coffee contains ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />Maybe it's the root that does it?  Whatever it is, be prepared to enjoy this arabica coffee only if you really enjoy sweet, intense vanilla flavor."
2033,Neutral,Brew it cold!,"Okay, here's the deal.  I make salad dressing from scratch.  I get out a nice, green fruity extra virgin olive oil and spices and some decent white or red wine vinegar, and make something entirely superior to, while still generally cheaper than, those supermarket blends of indifferent grade spices and chemical thickeners, swimming in mostly-canola oil.<br /><br />And why the heck am I talking salad dressing in a coffee review?<br /><br />I make coffee, I tend towards the similarly purist.  Whole bean.  You can get a basic grinder model for the price of a pound or two of the beans, and pre-ground is pre-staled, under the best of circumstances.  As for flavoring?  Flavoring is something I've long believed was invented by coffee brokers to get the lower grade stuff off their shelves.  And those flavors are generally lab-created, both for economy and for more precise/consistent control of the product.<br /><br />So I obviously come to this coffee with my biases, but I also love Starbucks coffees, bought whole from a Starbucks storefront.  I do notice a quality difference right away with the supermarket blends - I think in their own stores, the beans just turn over faster.<br /><br />Yet, as it happens, Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla coffee has (for me) a few advantages - chiefly, natural flavoring.  In this case, vanilla, and sasparilla, long a favorite ingredient of old-fashioned carbonated beverages.<br /><br />Brewed my first cup in my coffee maker.  And I hated it.  Very odd, unpleasant, cloying, bad, chemical taste.  Any vanilla taste or aroma, stayed behind in the bag.  Now, other reviewers clearly, have loved it.  Did I get a bad batch?  (This happens.  What one reviewer says about one bag has to be taken as one data point only.)<br /><br />Unwilling to give up on a perfectly, well, full bag, I decided to try cold brewing.  You can buy a fancy appliance (Amazon here carries no less than 4 systems for the purpose), or you can acquire a largish (6"" or so) fine mesh strainer and a quart jar.  Stir together ½ lb of ground coffee with 4.5 cups cold water, and refrigerate overnight.  Strain the next day, and the resulting concentrate stays fresh tasting for a week or 2.  You'll need to add water in a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 ratio, with the ""1"" being the concentrate.<br /><br />The cold brewing technique has its pros and cons.  Pro:  it's really convenient to make a week's worth of concentrate, as most of the ""work"" is just giving it the time to steep.  For the acid sensitive or just those who just prefer a smoother brew, it is a miracle.  But for the ""Con"": the real nuance and complexity of some of the best coffees comes along with the coffee oils that release under HEAT, and I do notice some flavor loss with some of my favorite coffees, cold brewed.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla was made for cold brewing.  The delicate essence of non-lab created flavors held up much better un-""cooked"".  I tasted vanilla, and yes, even the sasparilla, which people tend to know from Root Beer.  The off notes were still there in the background but more carbonated-soda reminiscent than they were harsh or offensive.  And yes, this is darning with faint praise, but...<br /><br />I'd buy this.  If I had a group to caffeinate for a hot summer event, and minimal time to futz with grinders or syrups or vanilla beans or cooling and icing hot coffee, this would be the trick.<br /><br />For home use...sorry.  Whole beans.  An extra 30 seconds of effort for 10 times more taste, and maybe a dollop of the Torani syrup, if my heart is set on flavoring.<br /><br />So, Starbucks, if you can ""infuse"" a whole bean with all natural flavors, I'd love to hear about it.  Maybe you could just sell the beans with a bottle of ground vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg/whatever powder like you have in your stores - low tech, but lovely.  In the meantime, 3 stars for a catering/get-together blend that is admittedly worlds better than you average foodservice pre-ground.<br /><br />Just brew it cold."
2034,Neutral,Meh,"About the best that can be said for this is that it lacks the strong chemical aftertaste most vanilla coffees have and affords less overwhelming vanilla flavor than most.<br /><br />It is supposedly made from fresh ground vanilla beans and not vanilla extract, yet the chemical taste remains.<br /><br />Not a good choice for an everyday coffee, but if you want vanilla flavor which doesn't knock you over not a bad one."
2035,Neutral,Okay coffee but cannot detect any vanilla,"This coffee is okay but I am unable to detect any vanilla flavor either before or after brewing.  I also found the coffee to taste a little more bitter than most coffee blends.  Despite this, it smells like typical coffee during brewing (which is very nice) and makes an average cup of coffee as if  you bought the unflavored variety.  I also had my boyfriend try this who is a heavy coffee drinker and he agrees with this assessment.  He and I feel the Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla Flavored coffee is just average."
2036,Neutral,"Good, just not...really good","I'm not any kind of coffee snob since I usually kill it with creamer anyway, but I do love my flavored coffee, vanilla expecially.  I've had some mixed results with Starbucks coffee, generally preferring their plain roasts, but I've never tried Fusions.  I think I'd rather stick to another brand for my flavored.<br /><br />The bag itself was a lot different from nearly any bag of coffee I'd ever purchased pre-packaged.  It was sealed, but not vaccum-packed, and the loose grounds only filled about 2/3s of the bag.  This isn't a brick.  It also was extremely easy to open, which was nice for my fingers, but considering what I usually end up wrestling with in other mail-order coffees, I wonder if the other stuff was unnecessarily difficult or if this was just packed the right way.<br /><br />The grounds had very mild vanilla scent, nothing like the beans you grind in the stores or even inexpensive stuff you buy in cans.  It didn't get any stronger when I brewed it.  I was afraid I hadn't used enough grounds, since I hadn't used the recommended amount (it was double what I use with my usual grounds), so I made another pot and had the same results.  While the second pot tasted better overall, it wasn't really any more ""vanilla"" than the first and it still had a little bit of a medicinal flavor to it.<br /><br />My recommendation if you really want a good aromatic vanilla flavor would be to stick to another brand coffee; Millstone and Melitta make good versions if you want to go the fancier route and if you're lucky and live in the area or can get it mailed to you, Steep and Brew is the best I've ever had.  Honestly, the various kinds of Folgers vanilla give better taste bang than this."
2037,Neutral,"good, not great, flavor","I've tried three different flavors of Starbucks ""Natural Fusions"" coffee so far.  Even though I love cinnamon and sometimes add some ground cinnamon to my coffee grounds to flavor regular coffee, I didn't much care for the flavor of Starbucks cinnamon flavored coffee.  This vanilla flavor is pretty good, however, though I will say that I don't like it enough to buy it again.  The real winner of the three is the caramel flavor.  While drinking it won't make you think you're eating a caramel candy, it does have a very pleasing flavor whether consumed hot or cold.  That's the only flavor of the three that I have purchased repeatedly and will purchase again.<br /><br />As for the underlying coffee flavor of this particular flavor, I think it suffices to say that it tastes like a medium roasted Starbucks coffee.  I happen to like Starbucks' coffee beans, but I know some people don't care for the brand.  If you're a fan of Starbucks, this roast/flavor is consistent with what you've come to expect from them."
2038,Neutral,"Very nice aroma, but lacking a bit in vanilla flavour","I like Starbucks. My partner does not much care for them. So you get both sides of the spectrum in this review.<br /><br />On opening the bag (which didn't seem to be vacuum packed ??) the coffee smells slightly of vanilla and you can see little bits of bean (or something non-coffee) in the mix. While brewing I have to say I didn't smell much, but when the coffee is poured into the cup there is a nicely subtly hint of vanilla aroma. (Nothing like the Folger's we often buy, because...hey! We are cheap).<br /><br />My partner says: it's ok. It almost tastes like someone put vanilla extract in the pot because there is an almost alcoholy aftertaste to the brew.<br /><br />I get almost no vanilla flavour, but the scent is pleasant. It tastes like regular Starbucks coffee which is to say slightly more bitter than grocery brands and more drying to the tongue with a nice roasted aftertaste.<br /><br />At $6.50 (if you buy enough to get free shipping) a bag this is OK, but you might find it cheaper (if you like it) at your grocery. They just got it at our local store & it is on sale for about the same price. We liked the Melitta coffee we tried better...and--well to be honest the Folger's Gourmet has a lot more flavour."
2039,Neutral,Not much bang for your buck,"As stated on the packaging, this vanilla flavored coffee by Starbucks has a ""subtle flavor and an indulgent aroma"".  So much so, in fact, that brewing the coffee is a more satisfying experience than drinking it.<br /><br />Going off of the recommended 2 Tbsp of coffee for every 6 oz. of water, I found the brew diluted and weak-willed.  Stepping up the dosage does deliver a more powerful vanilla taste, but you'll find yourself plowing through the 11 oz. bag at a much quicker rate.<br /><br />All told, if a light, mild vanilla brew is what you're after, this offering by Starbucks will suit you.  If, however, you're after a more potent brew, you would likely get more bang for your buck with a less ""subtle flavor."""
2040,Neutral,Smells Great - Tastes Bitter - Disappointing,"This coffee - Starbucks brand Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee - smells incredible when you open the bag, even better when the coffee is brewing, and after the coffee was done brewing, my entire house smelled like the inside of a Starbucks Coffee Store.  Excellent.<br /><br />As for the taste? The taste is something of a disappointment. This coffee has a definite bitter edge and the vanilla aspect is extremely light, definitely overpowered by the bitterness.  If I was going to have a house party, I'd probably brew this coffee just for the way it smells. This creates a great party-like atmosphere, but for day-to-day coffee drinking enjoyment, the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, probably won't live up to the expectations of most gourmet coffee drinkers."
2041,Neutral,"Not disappointed, not impressed.","As a self-confessed coffee addict for the past 20 years, I'd like to think that I'm a good judge of coffee.  Yes, if you poke through my previous reviews, you'll see that I rated a bag of Yuban (Breakfast Blend) rather highly.  So you may be surprised at my middling review of a bag of Starbucks and might therefore brand me a ""hater"". I am not. I love their Sumatran, Komodo Dragon, Anniversary Blend and their Christmas Blend.  AND, I was really looking forward a ""subtle flavor"" of vanilla in a cup of coffee. Now that we're all clear:<br /><br />Opening the bag of Starbucks Natural Infusions Vanilla, you'll immediately be hit by the scent of vanilla.  I was a bit scared that the coffee would wind up overpoweringly vanilla once brewed, but it wasn't so.  The vanilla is pronounced, but not overpowering once brewed.  HOWEVER, once brewed, the coffee beans' origin is immediately obvious.  The bag says ""Latin American beans"" but what they mean is Colombian. There's no mistaking that distinctive scent or taste.  Also, this is not a dark roast, not a bold coffee; it's a tame pseudo-breakfast roast.  It is a bit oily, but not overly so. (As another reviewer noted, this may be due to the added glycerin.)<br /><br />Point of interest: I drip brewed 6 cups for my initial tasting and did not add anything nor doctor the brew.  And onto the taste: very Colombian coffee, definitely vanilla, mildly sweet.  Starbucks not only added vanilla to the ground coffee, but they also added sarsparilla root and ""natural flavor"" including corn maltodextrin.  This is likely why it comes off as sweet when served black.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is there, make no mistake.  And the sweetness is there too.  No, this isn't as pronounced as adding a shot of flavored syrup to your coffee, but it isn't as subtle as the packaging would have us believe. If you like flavored coffee, this is right up your alley.  But, a note to coffee drinkers who like their coffee strong and bitter: this is not the coffee for you!<br /><br />I don't hate this coffee, but I don't love it.  If someone served it to me, I'd drink it (black) and not complain... until I got home.  ;-)"
2042,Neutral,Most people will like this; aficionados not so much,"This Starbucks coffee is a (very consistent) medium grind which works perfectly either in a coffee press or for drip (filter) brewing.<br /><br />The aroma from the bag and the cup is distinctly, and strongly, vanilla.  If you actually like the flavor of coffee (as I do), you will not find it here.  Starbucks states that they used a lightly roasted Latin American bean that sets off the flavor.  In my opinion, it sets it off too well, as the only flavor I could detect was the vanilla (and ""other natural flavors"").<br /><br />Sipping the coffee, it had a round, smooth taste and feel and low acidity.  The coffee press let the oils through that were trapped by the filter in the drip test cup and felt a bit oily to me, perhaps from the vegetable glycerin added to bind the unidentified ""natural flavors"".<br /><br />I grind moderately to dark roasted beans for each cup prior to brewing and actually like the flavor of coffee with (rarely) at most some subtle additional flavor.  The vanilla flavor here is neither subtle, nor completely natural if you happen to be someone who has cooked with actual vanilla beans.<br /><br />Folks who like flavored coffee will probably like this as long as they appreciate the difference between flavored coffee and coffee into which a sweet flavored syrup has been poured.  Folks I know who typically buy ground coffee for an automatic coffee maker would enjoy this."
2043,Neutral,Okay coffee- No love~No hate,"I tried this Starbucks coffee thinking that it would be a more mild roast coffee in order for the ""real vanilla"" flavor to show through.  It smelled good and I had high hopes for a true vanilla flavor mixed with a high quality coffee.  What I tasted was a very robust, deep roast, coffee with a bit of vanilla flavor.  It's just not what I prefer.<br />I can't say that i hated it but nor can I say that I loved and would put it on my groccery list.  I was unimpressed and will still hope for something better."
2044,Neutral,could be better,"I'm used to going to Starbucks for vanilla lattes and I was hoping this coffee would have a sweet vanilla flavor to it.  Although I'm glad to be contributing to buying Starbucks products, this coffee flavor is a let-down.  If there is a hint of vanilla flavoring to it, it's extremely subtle and I was unable to notice it.  If you buy this and you're looking for it to have a sweet vanilla flavor, I would recommend buying a syrup to add to the coffee."
2045,Neutral,Doesn't taste as good as I thought,"I had originally thought that this Starbucks coffee will taste as good as the ones they sell at their stores. But it is not as good. The coffee doesn't taste as strong as other coffee (like Blue Mtn Hawaii coffee). Overall, you pay for what you get. I paid a discounted price on this, and I got a lesser quality product."
2046,Neutral,Just Ok,"I love good coffee.  So when I picked up this Starbucks Natural Fusion Ground Vanilla I was excited just to open it up and smell it. To make a long story short, I kept making excuses for the coffee several pots later and half way through the bag it sits on the shelf.  I've actually considered tossing it out but it's not terrible. So I'll use it when I run out of other brews or when I have guest who just wants an average cup of non flavored coffee. I've never heard, ""oh this is Vanilla?""<br /><br />I made excuses for this brew because it is ""Natural Fusion"".  The thinking being that it was organic and little or no chemical process used, but even if that's true it just tastes average and hardly like the Vanilla flavored beans I normally use.<br /><br />Sorry Starbucks."
2047,Neutral,Not to my taste,"Overall the coffee is OK - tastes fine and is very typical of bagged Starbucks coffee.  The Vanilla is almost not present, which may be a good thing although I wanted it to have just a bit more kick.  There's a slight acidity that makes this a better afternoon or after dinner coffee, rather than breakfast.  I didn't love it and I didn't hate it, but doubtful I'd get any more."
2048,Neutral,Still bitter.,"In two senses, this coffee leaves me bitter.  On the one hand, I've had several years of trying Starbucks home coffee of various kinds and in various ways, and in no way have I been able to get it ""perfect.""  On the other hand, I gave it another shot with this product, and, while it definitely tastes better than other Starbucks home coffees I've had (hence the three stars), it still has a sense of bitterness.<br /><br />My co-worker, who is much better at brewing coffee than I am, made a pot at the office and told me to try some.  I did, hoping to get that amazing taste other reviewers have mentioned.  After making the cup of coffee that I always do, I sat down at my desk, had a sip, and waited for the full experience: the taste on the tongue, the swirl to the rest of my mouth, the final swig down my esophagus, and, finally, the awaited aftertaste.  It was fine until the last step: the aftertaste.  Here is where I recollected the pangs that bitter coffees leave, and it'll be a while till I try home-brew Starbucks again.  My co-worker even admitted it was bitter.<br />Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not completely anti-Starbucks.  While this specific home-brew leaves a wonderful vanilla initial taste, the in-store coffees taste better (but are still bitter to me), and their specialty drinks are amazing.<br /><br />Because I've had horrible experiences with Starbucks home-brew coffee, I wait for my trip to my grandparents' to drink home-made coffee, and will settle with my Nescafe."
2049,Neutral,a bit on the bitter side,"Does have a small hint of vanilla, but not as strong as you would get in a typical vanilla Latte. Leave a bitter, ""chemically"" after taste. We will stick to our regular coffee."
2050,Neutral,"Decent tasting coffee, just a bit bitter for my taste","I am a huge vanilla flavor fan. I love anything vanilla flavored. So naturally, I figured that I would love this coffee. The aroma is great when I open the package and dumped the ground coffee into my coffeemaker. I had high expectations for this.<br /><br />The coffee itself, once it is made is actually only decent tasting. I could only taste a very small hint of vanilla in it and it might have been because of my creamer and not the actual coffee itself. It was a bit bitter compared to other coffees that I have had and very rich. I usually take my coffee with cream and a small amount of sweetner and never really had problems with it being still too bitter.<br /><br />Next time, I guess I'll just use more cream and sweetner. Don't get me wrong, this is not completely horrible and I still enjoy Starbucks. It just surprised me as how bitter it was."
2051,Neutral,Vanilla flavored Starbucks coffee is not bad,"First, I have to confess that I don't care for flavored coffees. However, vanilla is one of my favorite flavors in other food products. So, when I came across this coffee, I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I have been consuming this coffee for the past 3 days and I can only say that I can tolerate this coffee. It didn't change my opinion of flavored coffees. I will still avoid them.<br /><br />I will return to regular coffee from now."
2052,Neutral,Not as good as their unflavored coffees.,"I am a flat-out fiend for good coffee.  I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee."
2053,Neutral,"If Flavor is Your Choice, Nothing Wrong Here","Firstly, I do drink a fair amount of coffee during the winter months.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I tend not to drink flavored coffee.  This is ground, flavored coffee.  Starbucks has not previously offered flavored coffees themselves because they know it will contaminate unflavored coffee in a grinder.  They are getting around this by only selling the coffee pre-ground, therefore, no customer will ever request it to be ground.<br /><br />When first opened, the quality is decent despite being pre-ground.  However, I do find, the quality of the product slips away fairly quickly being a ground coffee.<br /><br />Furthermore, again, I am not a particular fan of flavored coffees.  If I need a sweetener or flavor, I'd prefer to add it myself.  Nevertheless, this  vanilla flavored product is not terribly unpleasant.  I was able to enjoy it on a quiet morning or two when I wasn't demanding the very best.<br /><br />If flavored coffees is your thing, you will likely have no problems at all!"
2054,Neutral,it's coffee...,"I am no effete coffee genius who can go into the infinite spectrum of points about what makes a coffee good or not so good, but I do appreciate an astounding, wake-me-up twist on an old theme. This isn't it.<br /><br />While achieving everything an adequate coffee should provide, Starbuck's Vanilla Natural Fusions Ground Coffee is just that - adequate coffee. I was not blown away by subtle essences of vanilla; it did smell pretty good while brewing, which I suppose is the aim of coffee in general (one of the Top Ten Smells in the world, IMO, is a good coffee brewing up), but the flavor wasn't any more spectacular than any other coffee on the market. I would categorize it as robust, full-bodied, and - good. Not wow, do-cartwheels, jump-up-and-down...just that - good. Maybe the vanilla essence needs to be a little more noticeable, but for flavored coffee, I prefer Gloria Jean's."
2055,Neutral,Not my favorite flavored coffee,"I'm not sure why, but I do not like this as much as some other flavored coffees.  The flavor is very  noticeable, but it does not remind me of vanilla the way I would like.  I associate vanilla extract with the chocolate chip cookies I use it in, or rich vanilla ice cream.  I did not get that flavor in this coffee.  I won't buy it again."
2056,Neutral,"Good, but not Too Vanilla-ey","I enjoy Starbucks coffee very much and I generally like vanilla flavored coffee. This coffee is promising but I found it a little bitter. I drink my coffee strong and perhaps I have brewed it a little stronger than it should be but I found the drink good, but rather bitter. I tried it for several days and still found the bitterness every time. I tried it with less sugar and more sugar and cream and no cream but it was still a little bitter for me no matter what.<br /><br />Starbucks has many good flavored coffees for the holidays, and in general, and I drink them often. This coffee to me, didn't live up to the wonderful flavors I have drank that carry the Starbuck's name. I think the coffee needs a little more of the vanilla flavor unless Fusion means that it's just a hint, and it's a very small hint at that.<br /><br />The coffee itself smells very good and it also smells wonderful when it's brewing, but it lacks a little something that would make it really good. It needs a little more vanilla and less of a bitter taste to live up to the vanilla in the name."
2057,Neutral,OK for a flavored ground coffee,"I was a bit hesitant to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> because I typically do not like flavored coffees and prefer whole bean coffee which I can grind myself. But for a flavored ground coffee, I suppose this one is OK.<br /><br />The flavor is not bad but the aroma is intoxicating. (I think I prefer the way the coffee smells rather than how it tastes.)  The lightly roasted Latin American arabica coffee beans are flavored with ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root, and the ambiguous ""natural flavor"" (which also includes corn maltodextrin and vegetable glycerin). The vanilla is highlighted but not overdone.<br /><br />I usually drink my coffee black and without sweetening and for my taste <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>  can stand alone without additional enhancement.<br /><br />The brewing recommendations suggest 2 Tbsp coffee for every 6 fl oz water.  I find that a bit too much and get a smoother, less biting flavor with 1 1/2 Tbsp coffee per 6 fl oz water, but that of course is to my taste.<br /><br />I do wish the coffee could be fair trade and organically grown but Starbucks states on the package that the coffee is ""100% Responsibly grown.  Ethically traded.""  At least that is something in the right direction.<br /><br />Finally, I noticed a special offer on my package ~ take the empty bag of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> to a participating Starbucks and receive a free ""tall"" brewed coffee. That's nice, eh?"
2058,Neutral,where's the vanilla?,"Great Starbucks coffee taste.  Not the first hint of vanilla.  Very disappointing if you ordered it for the ""vanilla fusion""."
2059,Neutral,The vanilla's a little TOO vanilla for me.,"Yes, I know. It says ""vanilla"" and you expect it to taste like vanilla. What am I complaining about? Well, I was sort of expecting it to taste a bit more like coffee with a hint of vanilla, but instead this tastes like a blend of vanilla and coffee, in that order. Some people say they barely taste the vanilla. For me, it was front-and-center. It also had a sort of acid feel in the mouth, like fake vanilla, even though it says it uses real vanilla beans.<br /><br />It's good coffee, though. Quite strong, quite potent, and well-ground, it works in any coffee maker and it doesn't take much to make a nice, strong cup of coffee. It's just not for me. I'd recommend cutting this with another plain coffee, to minimize that strange vanilla flavor.<br /><br />If you like vanilla, you'll probably like it. Me? I think I'd rather just order a mocha."
2060,Neutral,Typical Starbucks,"As of this writing there have been 255 reviews posted. Sorta difficult to add anything new. I received one bag of this coffee from the Vine program. The day preceding its arrival I had brewed some French Vanilla by a brand that I regularly use and which is rated higher than Starbucks by the best known testing and rating org. This offered me an opportunity to make a somewhat taste comparison although, admittedly, the Starbucks was not French Vanilla.<br /><br />In the taste test Starbucks came in second. It was neither as smooth nor as tasty as the competitor. I drink my coffee with fat-free milk and no sugar so I get a fairly good opportunity to evaluate the taste. Starbucks afficionados undoubtedly will praise this and they have every right to do so and I have no quarrel with that. However, if you are not among that group I think you will find that you would be pleased with a different brand and save a few bucks as well."
2061,Neutral,Is it necessary?,"I'm not a big flavored coffee fan, but, for some reason, around the holidays it seems like I want to drink flavored coffee. Vanilla is my favorite, so when I got a chance to try this vanilla flavored coffee, I did it.<br /><br />It seems to me that every vanilla flavored coffee I've tried in the past did not really have a smooth vanilla flavor that I hoped for, and this one is no different. The vanilla doesn't seem to stand out or on its own. To me, the only way I can describe it is that the vanilla tastes ""burnt.""<br /><br />As a comparison, I tried adding Torani french vanilla syrup to my regular coffee. I liked that better. I think adding any type of vanilla flavor to regular coffee would produce a similar or better taste than buying it with the flavor already in it. So, is it really necessary to buy premixed vanilla flavored coffee?<br /><br />Maybe a coffee connoisseur would be a better judge of this coffee, but to me, the occassional flavored coffee drinker, this would seem a waste of money, especially since I doubt I'll use the whole package."
2062,Neutral,Overpowering flavor,"I love flavored coffees, but in many of them the added flavor overwhelms the coffee flavor.  While I do enjoy flavored coffees, I still want to taste the flavor of the coffee, too.  This Starbucks Vanilla-flavored coffee is a perfect example of a flavored coffee that comes on so strong that almost obscures the coffee flavor.  Additionally, the vanilla flavor in this coffee has what I can only describe as a ""chemical-edge"" and aftertaste to it.<br /><br />I found it undrinkable served full strength, but mixing the grind with a regular coffee before brewing tones down and smooths out the flavor to a pleasant level. For my taste, mixing it at a 1-to-4 ratio (1 scoop Starbucks Vanilla to 4 scoops regular coffee, for example) worked very well."
2063,Neutral,"Pleasant, But Ordinary Vanilla Coffee for a Cold Day","The doorbell rang on a frozen rain-rattled November afternoon. The postman left a box of Starbucks vanilla flavored ground coffee.<br /><br />Raggedly tired from the day, from the week, from the month, finding later autumn is rarely pleasant on its own merit, this was a good surprise. While plenty of coffee I had stocked in readiness for the first dismal days on winter, packages in the mail are like Christmas day presents. Eager, though already knowing what was inside, I smiled at the scent. Familiar. It reminded me of inexpensive coffee I bought before late novel-reading nights in college.<br /><br />Brewing quickly four cups, I poured the first taste into an old mug one of my first clients gave me, the one with pelicans on a sunny pier.<br /><br />Holding the mug with two hands, I sipped as anyone would hot coffee. Was it better, I wondered. No. Just ordinary. The vanilla was the same. The coffee was the same. Only the label was new. As it was already ground, it missed the freshness I can find even in any grocer who will grind the beans.<br /><br />I will finish the bag, and be glad I did, but having found nothing to compel me to look for it, I won't. If you have had vanilla flavored coffee, you have had this one.<br /><br />--Brockeim"
2064,Neutral,Good coffee.,"I enjoyed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Coffee. I wish it was whole beans instead of grounds, but that's ok... it still tasted fresh. I did find, however, that it wasn't very tasty until I put what I consider to be too much sugar in it. Typically, I only put a tablespoon, but I had to put 3-4 in this because it had an unusual taste to it. It may be that I associate vanilla with sweet, but I thought it was worth mentioning."
2065,Neutral,Downsized For Price?,"As a buyer of this prior, I am somewhat surprised to see this once 1 POUND had been reduced to just 12 ounces the last time I bought. Now? Just 11 ounces? Aside from the shrinking amount of coffee for the price (leaves a bad taste in my mouth!), how about the coffee? Well, I really have a liking for anything vanilla from juicing, to smoothies and coffee too. When drip brewed, I find this coffee a bit too full flavored (slightly bitter to me) and add a bit of creamer to soften it a bit. I am not a huge coffee drinker since a recent heart attack and had to go to decaf so this new batch is for my wife. She doesn't care at ALL for this brand however unless she pours in about 3-4 ounces of dairy creamer (coffee-mate French Vanilla from Nestle) so the price is just crazy for me when I see how she ""modifies it""! But this is from a guy who just drinks a cup of instant Folgers decaf every morning these days (sad I know).<br /><br />  So I have to defer to the connoisseurs on snob appeal and such. To me, it has always just been a nice cup of coffee before I was no longer able to drink with any caffeine. This brand was just one in a bunch of experiments I treated myself too after retirement before the heart attack. To ME, it is just an ""average"" coffee with an above average price. To be fair, remember I am not a big coffee person so this is perspective from an old guy who just was a casual drinker of coffee, not a fanatic. I just don't see the value given both my wife and myself added so much coffee creamer to get the desired taste of Vanilla? I still rate this 3 stars (average) since I may just not be the type of coffee drinker to ""appreciate"" something I just don't get. For what it's worth, I also prefer grilled hamburgers over grilled steak. And yes, beer over whiskey too.....No reason to beat up on a Company I really respect for it's success and quality treatment of their employees (but that's another story)!"
2066,Neutral,Is This Really Vanilla-Flavored???,"I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee. When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it. Vanilla-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial. I love Gevalia's French Vanilla, but prefer not to have to get regular shipments of a product.  I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards."
2067,Neutral,pretty good,"Starbucks vanilla is good, but definitely does not have as much vanilla taste as we would like.  Probably will not buy again."
2068,Neutral,Smells Better Than It Tastes,"As a disclaimer, I'm not necessarily a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I'd give this one a try.<br /><br />It's not the worse cup of coffee I've ever had, but it's hardly the best. Like most Starbucks coffee, these beans are a dark roast. The taste is smooth, but the vanilla flavor didn't seem to add much to the overall coffee taste. In fact, I hardly even noticed the vanilla when tasting the cup. The vanilla is most noticeable as an aroma when brewing the coffee, which is actually kind of nice.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was okay, but I'd rather just stick to regular coffee."
2069,Neutral,"Smells good, but tastes different","I love coffee and especially grinding my own beans. I use a fairly fancy Krups that makes excellent coffee. I have some favorites and few are flavored.  I do like the occasional hazelnut or vanilla flavors.  I was hoping to have a hint of the flavor, not an overwhelming one.  I was not disappointed.  The smell of vanilla was a lot stronger than the actual taste.<br /><br />The coffee was good, not great or otherwise outstanding, but good.  I'd call this an easy drinking coffee and I feel I could serve it without mentioning that it was vanilla flavored.  All in all, it's a good coffee with a *hint* of vanilla."
2070,Neutral,Not too far off the standard vanilla flavored coffee,"Lots of people don't care for the Starbucks roasts, but I happen to really enjoy them. This coffee has the standard Starbucks ""taste"" to it, so if you are one that does not care for the roasts in their stores, you probably would not enjoy this coffee, either.<br /><br />What I did not care for in this coffee was the strong vanilla syrupy smell. The aroma alone was a little strong for my liking and left that syrupy smell in my house for most of the day after brewing. A little could have been nice, but it was overly sweet. Compared to the smell, the vanilla infusion did not have as overwhelming a flavor, but my palate would still have prefered more subtlety in flavoring . If you are sensitive to strong sweet smells, you might also find this unpleasant. I think the smell impeded my ability to enjoy the taste, and may contribute to my ho-hum impression of this product."
2071,Neutral,Wonderful vanilla scent..........,"I typically am not a huge fan of Starbuck's coffee because it is a little too strong and a little bitter for my taste; so, I wanted to try this thinking it would be slightly milder in flavor.  The smell of this coffee when first opened was amazing.  The vanilla scent was very pleasing to the nose.  The coffee however did not carry the same strong vanilla flavor that the smell had.  My husband who does not like flavored coffees does not mind this flavored coffee at all.  He can taste a slight hint of vanilla which he does not mind.  The flavor for me is not strong enough but I can still use my flavored creamers which is enhanced with the vanilla infused coffee.<br />Basically this coffee is a matter of taste preference.  For us it turned out to be a coffee we both can enjoy."
2072,Neutral,overpriced and melted,"These are super delicious, and I really like the attempt to be more wholesome.  But kind of a rip-off, and mine all came melted and reformed into a giant ball!!  Gross... the canola oil is more noticeable like that"
2073,Neutral,Not as good as the regular SureJell,"My family loves homemade jam and we go through it so quickly that I bought this pack of 8.  I am torn because I hate putting huge amounts of sugar into the jam, but this low sugar (or no sugar added) pectin doesn't do as well as the regular kind.  So far I have only tried it with strawberry jam.  It doesn't taste as fresh, the color of the jam is darker, and it has a weird consistency to it."
2074,Neutral,Misleading Description/Deceptive Pictures,"I give the product itself a thumbs up. Coffee Mate is a good product. What is not good about this is the Distributor! Pay close attention and do not fall victim as I did. From the picture showing three bottles (one each of the flavors available) and the title saying "" Total of 2 each,"" I was under the impression that I was going to receive a total of six bottles; two of each flavor. This was not the case. I received two bottles of one flavor. I overpaid for these two bottles. Had the picture and title not been so deceptive I would have purchased from another distributor. Sorry Hugos, but these are going back to you. I will be getting a refund and taking my business elsewhere!<br /><br />By the way, I took a screenshot of the ad incase anyone wants to dispute my claims."
2075,Neutral,Nice flavor... but 11 servings? Three for me if I am good,"I like the flavor of the Nice! fruit & nut trail mix. The mix contains nuts ( mostly Peanuts and some Cashews) and dried fruit (Raisins, Banana Chips, Pineapple, Cranberries and Papaya). It is crunchy, sweet and chewy and often is just the right thing to calm sweet cravings.<br /><br />For a serving size of 1/4 cup it contains 150 calories<br />The label stats that this bag has 11 servings... but lets face it this is not going to last 11 servings.<br />The entire bag (11 servings) is 1650 calories. For me 1 bag typically lasts 3 servings... that means 550 calories per serving.<br /><br />Serving size 1/4 cup<br />Servings per container (12 oz) 11 servings<br /><br />Nutritional facts:<br />Calories total 150<br />Calories from fat 70<br />Total fat 8g<br />Saturated fat 2g<br />Sodium 60mg<br />Carbohydrates 15g<br />Dietary fiber 2g<br />Sugars 9g<br />Protein 4g<br /><br />I like the taste of this trail mix. However the current price on Amazon (seven plus shipping of six) compares very poorly to the price of this item in Wallgreens stores where it costs 3.99 per bag.<br /><br />Ali Julia review"
2076,Neutral,webDogTrainer.com review,This is convenient and your dog will like the taste.  It is a bit expensive and a cheap peanut butter could also do the trick!  Try putting it in the kong and freezing it to make it last even longer.<br /><br />-Julie the online dog trainer from www.webDogTrainer.com
2077,Neutral,Don't expect full flavor,"Since this is organic, they water decaffeinate it.  This means that instead of using high pressure C02 they use water.  This removes some of the flavor from the leaves but allows it to be organic.  C02 is not harmful, but the process is no longer organic.  There are other methods of chemically removing the caffeine, but those are considered a bit risky to longer term health.<br /><br />This tea is okay.  I would not expect the flavor from the English breakfast with caffeine.  If you are interested you should look up how to decaffeinate your own tea with water on Youtube.  You'll understand how the tea gets this way.<br /><br />As someone who has to worry about blood pressure genetically I watch my caffeine intake closely.  If you are a big tea person though stick to the stuff with caffeine and decaf it yourself."
2078,Neutral,Quality: 5 stars; Price: 1 star; Average: 3 stars,"My picky friends and I all agree that this is close to the ultimate in chocolate . . .<br /><br />. . . BUT . . .<br /><br />. . . at the current (9 April 2010) tarriff of $7.99 for ONE BAR (plus shipping on orders uder $25), we'll continue buying it at local supermarkets (and even at the store everyone loves to hate) for $2.18 or a bit more; sometimes less on sale.<br /><br />Amazon, I ADORE you -- you often have excellent prices, your web site is the best, and nothing has ever gone awry with anything from you, so I buy lots of food here in addition to DVDs, CDs, techie toys, clothes, garden & kitchen stuff, and, yes, books, but surely you can find a more reasonably-priced source!"
2079,Neutral,It doesn't taste like pineapple,"I suppose I may be fussy, but this jam just didn't impress me. It's too sweet and seems to lack the tart 'kick' one expects from eating pineapple.  I suppose I'll just have to go back to making my own."
2080,Neutral,Okay,If you're getting this for cleaning your teeth then it's pretty good. But I'd recommend a different flavor. This doesn't last longer than three minutes. But it does clean teeth in between brushing pretty well.
2081,Neutral,Require some extra effort...,"I am originally from Belarus and I used to cook tons of buckwheat in my live.<br />That buckwheat is something different from my idea of regular buckwheat. The grains are smaller, lighter in color, not toasted enough and when done it has bland scent not the full body aroma I remember. It cooks 2 times faster than original one-about 12 min., rather than 25min. and you need extra care if you want it flaky rather than sticky.<br />Here is some advices if you want have it close to my idea of original buckwheat:<br />1. Toast it in the pan or skillet with some butter over the medium heat for 2-3 min.(better to use a shallow pan than a deep one)<br />2.  Add salt, boiling water (2.2-2.5 parts of water to 1 part of gloats)<br />3. Lower the heat to just simmering and top tightly with the lid and cook until all water get soaked(do not stir-it breaks the grains)<br />4. Put it aside for extra 5 min."
2082,Neutral,Not as good as the Yoga organic one,"It is not as good as the Yoga Organic brown rice we usually have, Yoga is more tasty and cooks faster. This one takes longer(lonnnnng) to cook. But considering the price, it is ok. Still would prefer spending couple more bucks and buy the Yoga one..."
2083,Neutral,It's ok.,It was just rice.  Nothing special.  I just wanted to order it online because I didn't feel like going to the store.  It is also difficult to find large bags of brown rice.
2084,Neutral,Larger serving portions Needed,"my kids are in 1st grade now, and they do not want to drink from the kindergarten juice box size. It is a rite of passage into their development. Please offer this product and especially the carrot and apple in larger portion servings; even for the adults-please."
2085,Neutral,Good,My daughter has eaten gluten free for quite awhile and showed me the best products and this corn bread mix was one of them....She adds cheedar cheese...green chiles and a can of corn and says it is delicious..but as all this type stuff..it is pricey...it makes one small pan of corn bread for the cost of about 4 dollars...you use buttermilk for this instead of regular milk...
2086,Neutral,So-So,This cornbread is not as sweet as I would like.  I used paper muffin cups when I made it and half the muffin stuck to the paper so that was a bummer.  I think I like my mom's homemade GF cornbread better.
2087,Neutral,You will eat them till you're sick!,I had always heard about 'buckeyes' so decided to order some to distribute at Christmas.  The peanut butter is a bit much for me but my son and great grandson loved them and he WOULD eat them until he was sick if allowed.
2088,Neutral,Not quite as good as the S'mores flavor,"I bought these because they are a little cheaper than the S'mores flavor which I love. These aren't as good as the S'mores ones but I still would buy these again.<br /><br />Others have compared these to Oreo cookies which is a fair assesment. The outside chocolate is kind of dry and doesn't have a strong flavor. The filling in the middle has a melted marshmellow texture to it, somewhere between Oreo filling and marshmellow. They aren't overwhelmingly sweet. I like the frosting on the outside. These go perfectly with a glass of milk.<br /><br />I think kids would love these along with adults and I would recommend them. Great snack for the office, school, or just anytime you're craving chocolate. I'm a bachelor who can't cook so I'm sure I eat Pop-Tarts more than most people.<br /><br />Not bad, Pop-Tarts. Not bad at all."
2089,Neutral,sweet surrender,"guilty pleasure. cookies n cream is my fave ice cream flavor and apparently i'll eat anything that tastes like it. these are super sweet you can heat up, or have em right out the box for a quick sugar fix"
2090,Neutral,It is ok....,"I have heard a lot of reviews about coconut palm sugar (especially on Dr. Oz), so I decided to buy some.  Quite honestly, it has been kinda difficult finding things that I can use this stuff on or with.  I love coconut but it has a very distinct taste, which is not good in combination with some other flavors.  For the most part, this product is a novelty and has remained unused in my pantry. It isn't too expensive though and should be tried."
2091,Neutral,"Descent coffee, but . .  .","Right from the top, let me be clear.  I probably didn't purchase this for it's official and intended purpose.  I bought it for those hotel room coffee makers where the packets they provide are usually old, stale, and may have been in the room with the previous 20 people who stayed in your room.  The little 4 cup coffee maker on the counter used 3 of these at a time in order to make a decently-strengthed cup of coffee.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt (maybe it was the coffee maker itself).  That said, the flavor was good, just not very ""rich""/""bold""."
2092,Neutral,Not the same,"I was disappointed when I tried these. I was expecting a wintergreen flavor with a texture similar to the dipping sticks included in Fun-Dip, at least that's how I remember them tasting fifteen years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if the company that originally manufactured the original either went out of business or discontinued them as these were probably very controversial.<br /><br />This item tastes more chewy and chaulky and there's not much flavor other than sugar with a waxy coating. I can't help but compare these to antacids. They are also thinner and bent and look more like a hand-rolled cigarette than one that is mass-produced.<br /><br />I would like to add that even though I consumed candy cigarettes as a kid, I do not smoke as an adult. My parents and school always reminded me of the negative effects of smoking so I honestly never had an interest, but I do ironically enjoy candy cigarettes, but sadly these aren't what I remember."
2093,Neutral,it ain't Pernigotti... Not even close.,"Thought I would try this - its cheaper than my regular - Pernigotti Cocoa. I use this as a daily hot drink, sugar and milk to taste, topped with cinnamon and nutmeg.<br /><br />I would consider this product in the same class as Hershey or Trader Joe cocoa. Nothing wrong with it, but its not nearly as good as the Pernigotti. Not as dark in powder form, not nearly as intense cocoa taste as a hot drink.<br /><br />Its just ""ordinary"" cocoa powder, while the Italian stuff is really special, and worth the extra price. If I was baking with huge quantities I might feel differently, but in a hot drink this is the only thing you taste, and the difference is immediate.<br /><br />."
2094,Neutral,"Good quality, [very] bad price!","OK, the quality is good but the price is a rip off! Bought this item less than 4 months ago for $9.49... now the price went up to $23.75 = a 250% increase. As usual, buyers beware... from my own experience, there are much better alternatives on Amazon for this kind of stuff.<br />Rating: 5 stars for quality, 1 star for price = 3 stars overall."
2095,Neutral,"Weak flavor, boasts a great impression though.","I was so excited to try this cocoa powder, being that it is dutch-processed (smooth, non-acidic), organic and fair trade. I figured it would have a deep dark rich chocolate flavor. I make my own chocolate at home and to be quite honest, a generic grocery store cocoa powder or Hershey's renders a much more fulfilling chocolate flavor.<br />Why does this cocoa powder feel so weakly flavored?<br />3 stars because it wasn't bland, and has a wonderful impression being a sustainable product. Won't buy again."
2096,Neutral,Okay nothing outstanding,I was hoping for more flavor. I have purchased dutch cocoa from Wilbur and their dutch cocoa is great. It has a wonderful rich flavor. This is just okay it is dutch so it's better than hershey's but it's not dutch. I would not buy it again if I wanted dutch I would stick with Wilbur or just buy Hershey's for the price.
2097,Neutral,unpleasantly surprised,"given the reviews, i expected this stuff to be great. it's really not. the flavor just isn't there, and what is even more annoying is how incredibly difficult it is to dissolve the stuff in water (making hot cocoa is a real pain). i think the 'Now Foods' organic cocoa is far superior. i'd consider this stuff more similar to hershey's or big-name brands you can get at the store. yeah, you can eat it, but why?"
2098,Neutral,"OK, but not great","I was a bit disappointed in the brownies I made last night with this cocoa. I used the same recipe (from bag of King Arthur flour) that I always use and it didn't turn out so great. It was edible, but not as good as it usually is. I have used several different cocoas in the past and most recently used Guittard. I think I may try using Valrhona or Pernigotti; anyone have an opinion on either of these?"
2099,Neutral,funny tasting,"Decidedly not what I was expecting-- the taste is quite different from other dutch-processed cocoas I've used.<br />It tastes a little like a green smoothie; not bad if you can get used to it, but distracting if you were expecting that deep, rich chocolate flavor you normally get from a dutch-processed cocoa."
2100,Neutral,Buyer be careful with quantity....,"The lid is good, it works very nicely on two different can sizes. BUT, I thought I was purchasing two lids. The photograph shows two lids, but only one arrives. Read the fine print - there is only one in the description. $5.99 for a cat food lid!"
2101,Neutral,Does the job...,"I was disappointed when the product arrived and only one can cover was inside. I assumed by the image I was getting two covers - one orange and one yellow - but I only got the orange one. Had I known or realized this, I would have purchased from another vendor. So basically, I paid $6 for one lid. Boo. I was also frustrated that the lid was covered in stickers with glue that DOES NOT WANT TO COME OFF! I've tried to removed the sticky goop, but now I have to go buy goo-gone to get all the crap off. I don't feel like this lid fits as good as the lid I had previously. It works and gets the job done, but I don't think it's keep the food super fresh. Oh well, lesson learned."
2102,Neutral,Good Meal!,The tacos are great.  We love them and can't fing this dinner at our local stores.  Plan on buying extra taco shells though because about 1/2 will be broken on arrival.
2103,Neutral,too many peanuts,"Pretty good snack mix, but definately was too heavy on peanuts. Bags seem to not be evenly mixed."
2104,Neutral,"healthy, Good, Seedy","I like healthy granolas and cashews so i naturally like this. My only complaint is they went a bit overboard on the small seeds. I ended up eating most of it and all I had left was the small seeds on the bottom. I like seeds but that was a bit much. I will try the other flavors though as I do like the trail mix. I was almost surprised at the amount of fat though: 12g per serving, 5 servings a bag."
2105,Neutral,Contains Sodium Bisulfite,"I bought this after reading Opinunated's review of Sambal Oelek.  In their review they listed ingredients from label but failed to list all ingredients.  I thought I had finally found a chili paste that didn't have a bunch of preservatives.  Unfortunately Sambal Oelek has a couple.  Here is the entire ingredient list:  ""Chili, Salt, Distilled Vinegar, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Bisulite as preservatives and Xanthan Gum.  CONTAINS SULPHITE (Sodium bisulfite)""."
2106,Neutral,All's fair in love and chocolate,"Equal Exchange Hot Cocoa is... okay. It's good if you want something to warm you up on a cold winter evening. The directions say ""add hot water""... resulting in a blend that's somewhat bland,with a strange aftertaste. This is odd,considering that Equal Exchange's chocolate bars are excellent,along with their coffee. Perhaps it would taste better in hot milk. It's good for flavoring coffee. One can make a good cup of joe with it! I think I'll get their chili-flavored cocoa some time soon. THAT looks like it has a kick,unlike this."
2107,Neutral,This is MILD not MEDIUM roast,"While the product description on Amazon is ""Medium Roast"", this is actually ""Mild"" - clearly seen on the lower left of the package in the photo.  I didn't know this until I received my shipment today.  (I wish I had paid more attention to the photo.)<br /><br />I haven't tried the coffee because I'm generally a fan of stronger coffee.  I just wanted to warn that the description was incorrect."
2108,Neutral,"Well, it was worth a shot....","I purchased this as an attempt to get my 3 year old to eat come veggies (was trying to be sneaky and add it to things). Well, it's honestly pretty strong and tastes like veggies. He won't touch it or anything that has it in it. While I commend their efforts to make a healthy drink, it doesn't taste to good and won't work in our house."
2109,Neutral,A bit gritty and green,"I have to put this in a travel cup for my 5 year old or else he won't drink it.  He is too use to the smooth and chocolate colored chocolate milk.  It turns milk into a greenish cast and no matter how you mix it, it is a bit gritty but it does taste good.  I think its worth it for the benefits but when it comes to young ones, the way it looks matters the most.  It might just be my son but he totally thinks greenish milk is not cool (maybe because he associates it with veggies that he doesn't like).  I will still purchase it in the future because the positives out way any negatives."
2110,Neutral,Great nutrititious drink for kids,"I bought both the Berry and Chocolate drinks for daughter; however, she preferred the berry since it is sweeter.  I love the facts that it has a rainbow selection of vegetables and fruits some of which my daughter doesn't like to eat like spinach and sprouts.  Like another reviewer, I am also not thrilled with the fact that the powder drink contains ""Natural flavor"" which could mean msg.  When I approached a sale person at a major health food grocery store, he didn't even know what natural flavor is.  Since we ran out of the powder, I am hesistant to buy this same drink and feed my daughter because of the ""Natural Flavor"" ingredient.  It will be while until I find a good wholesome powder drink for my daughter since originally I planned to replace this drink with her vitamins' intake.  I give 3 1/2 stars since it has the natural flavor ingredient."
2111,Neutral,It's ok,"This product does not disolve easy with just stiring, I threw mine into the blender to get it mixed well. I would highly recommend anybody interested in this product should go to their local healthfood store and buy the individual packets first. These packets are single servings of the product and sell for a dollar something, this is a good way to try the product out to see if it suits your family without wasting a ton of money. This is what my husband and I did, we bought two of the chocolate flavor and one of the berry flavor and have tried both out on my preschooler. She didn't seem found of either of them, the choclate has a very light chocolate flavor and it had an overpowering after taste of the greens. The berry was just way to sweet I've read people compare it to koolaid and that would be about right if you like your koolaid with 2 extra cups of sugar in it. I have used the second chocolate packet in a breakfast smoothie for her with bananas and peanut butter and that seemed to get ride of the after taste and she seemed to enjoy it.If you don't mind being creative and doing a little extra work to mask the flavor of the greens this product could be a healthy addtition to your childs diet."
2112,Neutral,In theory this is a great product,"My son is a VERY pickey eater and I can't get him to eat a vegetable to save his life. I tried this product and I have had little success. He won't touch a single thing that I put this product into. I have tried mixing with yogurt, in a smoothie, in juice, in a PBJ, etc. No luck. I guess my son is just very pickey because this has a ton of positive reviews about taste. I have even tried the chocolate flavored and he turns his nose up at it. I even tried mixing the chocolate powder with chocolate milk and he still doesn't drink it!"
2113,Neutral,Good but Expensive...!,"Candy is delicious, as is all Godiva. They don't skimp on the flavor, so it's not a ""cheap version"" of Godiva. But it's overpriced here, as they are sold in most drugstores for $5.99 a bag. If my arithmetic is still good, 6 x 4 =24, so there is no need to buy it online, unless you live somewhere very rural. Thanks!"
2114,Neutral,"Salt, not spice","If you're looking for slightly ""improved"" salt this might work. If you're looking for spicy seasoning it won't - it is mostly salt, everything else can barely be noticed. Way too salty to be used as any sort of seasoning mixture.<br /><br />I've been using my safeway-bought cajun spice instead and it tastes much better..."
2115,Neutral,Mostly salt with a little kick,"This product is salt with some other stuff mixed in with it. The label is not real specific about what is in it other than ""salt, red pepper and other spices, garlic and silicon dioxide"".<br /><br />I use it strictly as a salt substitute. It has a little more flavor than just salt but to me it is not really Cajun seasoning as it has no real heat to it and is quite salty. It is just too salty to use enough of it to taste any heat, or to use it as a rub.<br /><br />I have gotten a canister of it as gift now and then because people know I like hot sauce. I use it, but I would not buy it on my own."
2116,Neutral,Rubber Apple,"The taste is not bad but the texture is not to my liking. It's like dried soft apple slices, just like what the another reviewer said, ""rubbery."" I wish it has a little crispness. Nevertheless, it beats snacking on potato chips. But would I recommend it.... NO."
2117,Neutral,Salty?,"I don't know if it's just me, but these taste rather salty to me. Perhaps it is the unnatural preserving additives found in the product's ingredients. Normally I'm quite fond of dried apples, but these just don't do it for me. My family members, on the other hand, don't seem to mind and actually enjoy them."
2118,Neutral,The bag lied,"I bought this thinking I was getting a bag of dried apples. It even says ""DRIED APPLES"" in the ingredients.<br />They're good, but this isn't what I wanted.<br />Dried apples are hard and crispy, not soft and chewy."
2119,Neutral,Satisfactory,"The flavor is ok, but, the product contains sulfiting agents.  Good product, just not a ""whole"" food."
2120,Neutral,Not so bad...,"Actually, the dried shrimp needs to be softened first. You wouldn't need to worry about its shell. It needs to be soaked in water for 15-30 minutes. Its ready when its soft enough to be easily chopped up. Then it can be used in stir fry. The price here is ridiculously expensive. It should only be around $2-$3 at an asian market."
2121,Neutral,Good...but not the best,"This is my third order of Turkish pistachios from three different vendors. As with the two previous orders, the nuts are good, but not the freshness or quality I experienced on my many trips to Turkey. At first I thought I was being too harsh in my assessment, heck Turkey is what 5500 miles away. But, on second thought , why shouldn't I expect a better quality nut? Yes, time is a factor in nut freshness, but how long should/does it take to get these nuts from Turkey? Or maybe they are keeping the best ones for themselves, I would. Anyway, out of 5 pounds we are about  half way through them as I write this review. The nuts are very lightly salted, which is perfect for me. The shell color is a perfect tan. Nut color has been the typical light/med green to an undesirable yellow/tan/brown, with the ratio being 50/50. The texture is, as expected, better with the green nut than the yellowish nut, which tends to be much drier, and powdery. One of the things you will find with Turkish pistachios are un-cracked shells. Trying to crack one is not easy, it fact they tend to shatter. So far, this batch has only yielded 4 or five un-cracked shells, pretty good. Would I buy again? YES, though they are not up to my expectations, they are still better than the California variety."
2122,Neutral,"It's ""Meh...""","I bought this locally for roughly the same price as here on amazon.<br /><br />I make ""Espresso"" using a stovetop pot or ""moka"" if you please, as well as my Aeropress.<br />For my Aeropress I use 185 degree water.<br /><br />I am an espresso person, at least the ""espresso"" that can be made with the above two devices. I really love a good cup of strong, flavorful coffee.<br /><br />I think an underlyign problem with coffees branded ""espresso"" is that they tend to be deep dark roasts, that put out a bitter aftertaste by nature. I've tried cooler water in the Aeropress, but it still comes out with that espresso...tangy bite at the end that makes you want to cringe after every sip.<br /><br />If you really want good coffee to be used in an espresso pot or maker, I would recommend just grinding down your already favorite coffee to the espresso powder, and brew with that.<br /><br />That being said, I rate this a 3 because it IS a good base for making flavored coffee drinks, because the flavor is so strong that it won't be masked by milk or flavors, giving you a pretty well rounded vanilla cappuccinol or just traditional cappuccino.<br /><br />So, overall, would not buy again, as I do not usually make espresso into specialty drinks, but rather I like it plain.  For this purpose...the flavor qualities of Cafe Bustelo are not up to par."
2123,Neutral,Muir Glen Tomato Sauce,"The sauce is great. All organic ingredients and nothing bad added. However, but most of the cans were severely dented."
2124,Neutral,"LOVE THE COCONUT OIL, HATE THE GLASS CONTAINER!","When it arrived, the glass container was broken. I had to get the coconut oil in another container. So some of the coconut oil were wasted since I didn't want to risk my luck getting hurt with glass in some coconut oil. I love the oil though. It smelled great! It penetrated in my hair well & it made it softer. I have natural 4a hair."
2125,Neutral,Don't know what all the fuss is about,"Got two of these, because the hype on it was so glowing.  I haven't used it much yet, but I can't see why it's so much better than other oils, except it is a lovely ointment for sunburn."
2126,Neutral,Doesn't smell coconutty,I love coconut oil and use it on hair and body and in lotions and lipgloss and occasionally even cook with it.  But I like the Nutivia oil better becasue it actually smells like toasted coconut.  That is really the only reason for the preference for me!  But this I have had and the consistency and texture are perfect.
2127,Neutral,"Great coffee, but...","Lavazza makes a fantastic coffee; however, these pods, designated ESE, do not work well with my Francis! Francis! ESE espresso maker.  In comparison, it takes an average of 20-22 seconds to pull a shot with the illy ESE pods.  These Lavazza pods take, on average, 5-8 seconds -- way too fast!  (Maybe the coffee is not packed well enough inside the pods?)<br /><br />When in Italy (and here at home), I drink a lot of illy and Lavazza, but, sorry to disappoint, these pods were not up to par!  Of course, if you're in a rush in the morning, maybe shaving off 15 seconds is a good thing!"
2128,Neutral,"Good deal, but some packets empty","This is one of the best deals for bulk pods, but in our recent box a bunch of the packets were empty (sealed but with no pod).  If this continues then this may not be that good of a deal."
2129,Neutral,OK...Just OK,"System: Handpresso. (I understand that calling the Handpresso an espresso machine stretches the definition but this review may be useful to other portable cafe addicts)<br /><br />I compared this to Starbucks, the only other ESE pod I have used (to date), though I am not a Starbucks coffee fan. 0 (not worth considering) to 5 (cannot be beat).<br /><br />Freshness: 3<br /><br />Quality (based on flavor): 3 (thin)<br /><br />Crema: 3 (not ""Gran"")<br /><br />Pack: 2 (not consistent, loose)<br /><br />Price: 5"
2130,Neutral,A bit weak,"I bought these after first using the Espressione Classic Coffee Pods, which I really liked. When I went back to by more of the Espressione pods and the price had increased by around $10, I decided to try these. I like a strong flavor, and these do not deliver. Next time I will go back to the Espressione and live with the higher cost."
2131,Neutral,Expresso Pods so easy to use!,"The price on Amazon for the box of 150 I ordered was a really great deal, however the flavor is not as intense as I would have liked it!"
2132,Neutral,Nice favor but poor tamping.,I too received a shipment of pods that are too loosely tamped. The water comes through much too fast. I have been using Starbucks and Illy for some time and they work perfectly.<br /><br />I did try the pre-wetting process and then tamping again but it's just too much trouble.<br /><br />The price is great but I just decided to go with a new Nespresso machine and wish I had done it sooner. 19 bars of pressure and even the milder lungo and decaf are wonderful!
2133,Neutral,"OK, but not robust enough for me","I wanted so much to like this coffee.  The price was great, especially after signing up for the subscription and the special Lavazza discount that Amazon had for the month of October.  Have a Cusinart EM100, which works well with espresso pods.  But I like strong coffee, and the Lavazza is just too mild for my taste. Think I will stick with the Intenso Gusto Forte, a robust espresso pod which I originally got from Amazon."
2134,Neutral,50/50 choice,"First of all it is loosely packed. When I first used the product, water came out first before I could see any coffee and that is entirely on the packing. To me the chocolate like taste is not for me. It tempers with the way I like my coffee to taste. Bottom-line it is not  nearly as good as Starbucks. Had I rated this product the first week I tried it, I would have given it one star.  But now since it has been a while I am a little more forgiving. It is cheaper than most pods to begin with. Pressing on the pod helps the loose packing problem. Since I drink at least 3 cups a day, I have chosen to make one Starbucks and then do the rest with this to save some. But if you ask me to entirely switch to this product, I wouldn't even think about it. However I would suggest the before you get 150 pack, first try the lesser package. At first I felt trapped with 150 pods that I hated until I compromised and coped. If you're not looking to save, look away. But if you want to save, after a while it is not too bad."
2135,Neutral,"Okay espresso, super convenient","When I first bought my new espresso machine, I thought I'd get ESE pods to make the espresso-making a bit easier and less messy.<br /><br />That's exactly what I got: the pods are easy to use, and make a decent shot of espresso.<br /><br />Then I started using Lavazza and Illy pre-ground coffees, and grinding my own. The resultant espresso is a solid amount better because you can much more finely adjust the dose and tamp - how much coffee goes into the portafilter, and  how hard you smush the coffee into the portafilter. Pre-ground or whole bean espresso is also a fair bit cheaper than the pods.<br /><br />So, if you want a *decent* shot of espresso, with no mess or fuss, go with the pods. If you are willing to put in a bit of effort, though, you can get better espresso at a lower price.<br /><br />As far as the pods go, the Gran Crema are the best I've tried."
2136,Neutral,A little bitter for me,"I use this with Handpresso.<br /><br />But for me this is a little bitter. Not the greatest, but I bought because of the reviews. These are just okay.<br />I will be trying other brands."
2137,Neutral,How do you store these?,"I love the convenience of having so many pods on hand, but wondering how everyone stores theirs.  I agree with the watery/fast draw, but mashing down on the opened package/pod has helped."
2138,Neutral,These are ESE pods,"For anyone on the fence, these are in fact ESE pods. There is a mark on the back of each individual package in the lower left corner.<br />That said, the coffee produced is slightly more watery than the Illy pods we are used to drinking. Even though the Lavazza is slightly watery (and you can fix that by running the shot for less time) the taste is actually pretty decent. And for a fast fix, with this price per pod, you can't go wrong.<br />Remember: Fresh roasted at home is best!"
2139,Neutral,Convenient but a little bland,These ESE pods sure are convenient but they were not very flavorful.  I like the Illy pods much better...better yet fresh ground is the way to go.
2140,Neutral,Bad Packing,Compare to other packing I will give 5 out of 10. It's a food product that should be pack properly.
2141,Neutral,My dog doesn't care for it.,"Well, it's kind of hard to review dog food. My dog doesn't seem to like this flavor much. He seems to prefer the lamb and rice version much better. This is a very high quality product, it seems, compared to other dog foods. It is not watery and doesn't stink to high heaven. We're vegetarians, so low quality meat makes me nauseated, but this product is okay in that regard. It's just not my dog's favorite. We only buy the lamb Pet Guard now."
2142,Neutral,"Perfect size, but goes quickly","Like everyone else, I bought these because they are all natural with no byproducts and they're the perfect size for training. I have a Pomeranian puppy and since he was 7 weeks old, I've had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness Puppy formula which has worked wonders for him and he cannot get enough of. He's now 7 months old and he's as perfect as can be. Prior to trying Zuke's, I used to feed him Pup-Peroni since he loved them, considering that he has a sensitive stomach, it worked for him. After my last batch was almost done, I figured I would buy a couple packs of Zuke's.<br /><br />Of course, his stomach has to get used to the product but his bowels has been watery and not as dense and hard as when he was on Pup-Peroni. He's been on Zuke's for a week and a half and he's still getting used to it. Also, the product goes really quickly as I only have a couple ounces left. So I'd say that 16oz lasts two weeks whereas 16oz of the Pup-Peroni lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />I'm thinking about switching over to the Pup-Peroni if his stools remains watery and soft as it's been 1.5 weeks since he's been getting Zuke's. I still have another pound of the Peanut Butter, so we'll see. All-in-all, my little man loves this stuff even if his stomach isn't digesting it normally."
2143,Neutral,"Smells Aweful, but Jimmy Loves It",I can't stand the smell of this treat.  They are very bite-sized (tiny little beads).  I wouldn't mind them so much if they smelled a little better.  As it stands I can't be near the opened bag without getting naseous.  My daughter feeds him treats now.
2144,Neutral,Eh.,"I wanted my pup to love these. He is a 11 week old Yorkshire Terrier and he doesn't seem too interested in them...Maybe he will when he a bit older? I dk...I mean, the product itself seems great...but my pup just doesn't like em'!"
2145,Neutral,Dog likes them!,"My dog likes these treats, but definitely prefers the peanut butter ones better.  One strange thing I've noticed with these treats is that they tend to harden very quickly -- so you're best off buying the small bag (seen here), not the bigger bag.  It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor.  But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small.  They're perfect for training, and Zuke's is always full of good things, not some crappy ingredients like some other dog treats out there."
2146,Neutral,"Good product, but packaging problem","My Wheaten puppy likes these treats and I like that they're made from good ingredients. But I gave this product three stars, because there was a problem with its packaging. The interlocking seal doesn't line up, so the bag is impossible to close. I guess I'll just repackage the treats myself. It's not a huge problem, but I'm just a little disappointed."
2147,Neutral,good treats but dog did not like them much,"My dog liked the smell of these at first and got really excited, but she got bored after just a couple of these treats. I had to use them as filler treats during training to get rid of them. I will not buy these again, since she doesn't like them, but the treats themselves are good, healthy and low-calorie."
2148,Neutral,"Don't hold Dog's attention, Gas","I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.<br /><br />She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.<br /><br />I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up."
2149,Neutral,My Yorkie doesn't like it,My 8-year-old Yorkie doesn't like it... he only eats when he is hungry.<br />I rate it as 3-star since my dog still eats it.
2150,Neutral,"Gave  my dog gas,","My dog seemed to like these, but not as much as other snacks he's been given.  And, I definitely didn't enjoy smelling the gas which was emitted after he ate these."
2151,Neutral,I'm sure they are good treats but my dog just didn't like them.,I bought these because I liked the fact that they were small and were intended to be used to train my dog. For some reason he just didn't like them. They also get hard pretty quickly.
2152,Neutral,Dog treats,Used these in my dog's puzzle toy -- he would eat them but never seemed very excited when he got them out of the toy.
2153,Neutral,Dog Loves Treats but Bad for His Teeth,"My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks.  I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay.  After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled.  I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training."
2154,Neutral,"good for dogs, bad for your nose","great treat, dog loved em, small and good for training.  but they smelled pretty bad.  we got the salmon and the chicken and both had an offensive odor.  won't buy again for that reason."
2155,Neutral,Dries out very quickly,"I was really looking for a moist treat for training my lab puppy.  However, these tend to harden up quickly.  My lab loves the taste but it takes him about 30 seconds to eat one, even when I break it in half."
2156,Neutral,My dog doesn't like...,"These treats sounded great, but unfortunately my dog doesn't really care for them.  I offered them to my cats and they didn't really want them either.  Maybe my pets are just being picky.  My dog does love Zuke's PB & Blueberry treats though!"
2157,Neutral,Chicken treats are STINKY!,My dog loved these treats but be aware that the Chicken treats reek!  You must make sure the bag stays closed and always wash your hands right after touching them. You certainly don't want to walk around with these in your pocket.  We didn't purchase these from Amazon but price is about what we paid.
2158,Neutral,um...okay,"I bought these as a gold box lightning deal and got the case for 26 bucks.  They are okay...kind of like a chewier 3 muskateers bar.  Would not buy again, but we will eat them.  As far as I could tell there are no actual almonds in there."
2159,Neutral,Gah! It tastes like paste!,"So. Three stars for the fiber and protein and low sugar content all rolled up in 100 calories. But, wait. The taste. Oh.My.God. It is like glue and chemicals and you had better not attempt to eat this thing without a bottled water in your other hand. I almost choked trying to get this sticky, pasty mess down my throat. Bummer! Now I'm back to square one, looking for a low-cal bar with both protein and fiber that tastes good, or at least decent. This bar tastes BAD."
2160,Neutral,It used to be better -,I have always loved Jolly Time Blast O Butter. It is now difficult to find it in the grocery store because of the change of the package cover.  Plus I have found that many stores dont even carry it.  So I was happy to find it on Amazon.  I ordered it but was very disappointed as it didnt have the same massive buttery taste.  They must have changed the recipe because I missed all the butter and wonderful taste. I needed to add more butter to the product.  Maybe one day they will go back to the original.
2161,Neutral,Excellent Product. Ridiculous Shipping Cost...,"While not made from fair-trade gourmet coffee, this ""coffe drink"" sure tastes good. It's the perfect blend of Coffee and milk and mocha flavouring~~ I guess you could call starbucks my weakness...Well . .Any type of coffee is my weakness (except instant coffee . .that stuff is fowl..)<br /><br />My only complaint is the $15 shipping cost . . .seriously!? That's almost as much as the coffee itself!! It's ridiculous! You're pretty much better off buying it from the store.....I did the math . .It's about $3.25 per bottle [if you buy it from the sellers on amazon] and that's pretty ridiculous in itself if you ask me . . .. Amazon really needs to start carrying this directly..."
2162,Neutral,Didn't expect them to be quite so bitter!!,"Not sure what I was expecting, but the little nibs are bitter and not very pleasing to eat - at least not out of hand.  Maybe if they were mixed in smoothies, etc."
2163,Neutral,"Good for travel, MUCH lower price in the stores","We used this when traveling with our 6 month old and it was convenient.  Beware though, the 6 pack of 8oz bottles are sold for $9.99 in our local ""big box"" store.  At $14.99 plus shipping, this is way overpriced."
2164,Neutral,Nipples not included,"We bought these for a plane trip, thinking it would be very handy not to have to mix formula or carry dirty bottles around.  The problem with these is that they don't include any disposable nipples, and the nipples from the bottles we use (NUK) don't fit these bottles, nor are the disposable nipples easily available.  They aren't made by similac, only enfamil for one thing, and enfamil only sells them in very large quantities which other people repackage in small quantities at ridiculous prices.  I did eventually learn that the baby's old medela nipples do fit these bottles, but it was a real hassle to figure all of this out.  I even contacted the company and they gave me very vague unhelpful advice.  At the very least I wish all of this was made clear in the product description!"
2165,Neutral,theres something wrong with the price here!,this is just $10 at store. Why would this seller here in amazon sell it this expensive!
2166,Neutral,A simple Review.,"While far from super sour, 8 lbs of Cry Babies is a bunch of sour."
2167,Neutral,"Not so beneficial, but good taste.","Green Tea has become the latest craze as more people find out the healthy benefits of Green Tea. It may help prevent strokes.<br />According to Dr. Nicholas Perricone, author of the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YNS0ZS"">The Perricone Promise: Look Younger,  Live Longer in Three Easy Steps</a>, green tea is one of the things you should have for 28 days.

2168,Neutral,The ones I got were past their prime,"I love Swedish fish, and though it would be fun to get some in small individual-serving packages.  However, while the best-before date on these is still 2 months out, they are definitely past their prime -- they are rather hard, which is disappointing."
2169,Neutral,Dog loves it Vet hates it!,My dog loves these treats but my vet said they are junk food.  So Louie gets one on special occasions
2170,Neutral,First 2-3 deliveries were great.  Last 2 ... not so much,"Decided to try Madhouse Munchies based on the description and the positive reviews.  No ... the opinion of an Olympic skier made no difference whatsoever except to wonder who out there actually believed that an an olympic skier is a more qualified determiner of potato chip quality than anyone else.  Anyway - my first delivery showed these to be good chips.  5 star ... or nearly so.  Second delivery supported the first.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars an an average.  Chips, when well made and fresh are probably closer to 5 stars.  I can't quite recall where it turned but it was either the third or fourth delivery.  This next delivery showed up with the box itself soaked with oil and every single bag within the box slit down the back seam.  It should have been nearly impossible for the person packing it not to notice and its difficult for me to believe that 12 bags spontaneously burst down the back seam in transit.  I reported it, threw them all out and Amazon refunded the money (thanks Amazon).  Next delivery, while not split down the seam, were very very greasy.  The chips were practically dripping oil.  Most recent delivery ... same thing.  I'll chalk the split seam issue down to logistics but the last two scream of manufacturing process changes or cutbacks or simply a malaise in the process.  Whatever it is ... that's all it really takes to lose a customer.  Lay's makes an excellent kettle chip, best I've had to date, and they sell it at the local small market where we pickup our milk for $2.29 for an 8.5oz bag.  That's a better price per oz than I was getting here.  I'm off the Madhouse Munchies bandwagon.<br />Giving this 3 stars as an average but this chip has been on a 5 star to 1 star slide.  Clearly they know how to make a good chip.  For whatever reason they just stopped doing it."
2171,Neutral,Not what I was expecting!!,From reading the reviews I was expecting a better product than this. To me it is just average and I won't be ordering again........<br /><br />PHRED05
2172,Neutral,Salt & Vinegar chips,These chips did have a terrific bite but still a bit on the greasy side but that's what Kettle chips are. My all time favorite is the Lays salt/vinegar but no longer in the stores where I reside and the company on amazon that sells them only has the 1.5oz (too small) and by the time you pay shipping...not worth it. Overall the Madhouse Munchies not bad and the 5oz size is quite lg. There was a promotional special when I ordered so got the case at a great price on Amazon.
2173,Neutral,unimpressed by flimsy chips,"I bought these chips because of all the positive reviews (and because they were cheap, with Amazon discounts), but I'm underwhelmed by both the Madhouse Munchies chip flavors I've purchased:  the Mesquite BBQ mentioned here, and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDKZZK"">Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />The chips are perfectly edible (unlike some other chips I've tried, I won't have to give away every bag because I can't use them at all at home), but thin and insubstantial -- at least compared to the much superior Kettle brand chips I've been buying from Amazon, such as their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBVO"">Kettle Chips, Sea Salt & Vinegar, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> and their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4FI"">Kettle Krinkle Cut Chips, Salt & Fresh Ground Pepper, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> -- and the 'fire sweet' smokey quality of the barbecue flavor is a bit overpowering (especially with a weak chip underneath, offering nothing to back it up with other flavor notes).<br /><br />I'd prefer to get much more satisfaction and flavor in return for my caloric over-indulgence than is offered by Madhouse Munchies snacks so far.<br /><br />Unless you've already tried Madhouse Munchies brand from your local grocery store and loved their chips, I wouldn't advise purchasing this in bulk just yet.  There are far better chips available here for just a little more money (when you take advantage of sales and discounts)."
2174,Neutral,Not as full or nice as pictured,"Received the ""the best of Ghirardelli Gift Basket,""  was giving it as a gift.  Looked fulled in the picture, also instead of being set(as per picture) all the chocalate was in a pile inside the red basket covered in plastic.  You had to ripe the plastic open to try to set it up to make it look presentable and then nothingheld the way it was shown. It looked like a mess and not a great gift basket"
2175,Neutral,Good Value but does not look like picture.,I purchased two of these to give as gifts during the holiday season. From the picture it seemed that the chocolates and other goodies would be upright to give the basket an extra visual appeal. However on receiving the basket the chocolates lie flat. The quality of the product is not questionable. However the over appeal as a gift is decreased because of this. Good product overall.
2176,Neutral,Cocoa bags of paper and punctured = big mess.,"This is a very nice set, but as the other reviewer I paid $13 and wouldn't have paid more. The cocoa pouches are made of paper and was punctured by the box of chocolates next to it. This resulted in a lost cocoa and a big mess I had to clean up before I could send this to the recipient. Which is sad, not only for the lost product, because it doesn't all stay in the box very well without the plastic encasing."
2177,Neutral,No excuse for this much trans fat,"Big Train's mixes taste pretty good, but there's no excuse for the huge amounts of trans fat they contain. Partially hydrogenated coconut oil -- pure trans fat -- is listed as one of the first ingredients! (The nutritional information posted by Amazon must be for a different product, because it incorrectly claims that the product contains zero trans fat... not possible with that ingredient list.) According to a nutritionist friend, even made with skim milk they are, nutritionally, heart attack city. (I'm surprised that they haven't changed their formulas simply so that they can be sold in the city of New York.) And I don't want Big Train to give me a big caboose. So, I'm holding off on buying more of this. I'll mix up my own smoothies until they make their product more healthy."
2178,Neutral,changed more than the packaging,"they changed their packaging and stuff in the last year and it appears they've tweaked the recipe as well. They used to be sweeter, very cardboard like now. Great for small kids who don't know any better but I cannot imagine anyone older than 12 willingly choking these down. Texture and flavor not what it once was."
2179,Neutral,Peanut Butter Cookies,These cookies were delivered on time and the package was as described.<br />We usually buy these cookies from a discount warehouse store but they ran out.  The package from the discounter is slightly different from the Amazon.com supplier but the cookies are the same.  After totaling the price and shipping we found that it costs less to purchase from the warehouse store when they have them.  It is more expensive to buy these cookies on-line than to buy them in the store.  Nevertheless my son enjoys the cookies and we are satisfied.
2180,Neutral,"Not like Oatmeal, but tasty none-the-less","I was disappointed at first, these taste nothing like Oatmeal cookies.  You'll be disappointed, too, if you buy them looking for a yummy Oatmeal cookie, they taste more like ""Ranger"" cookies (e.g. Krogers).  They do taste good and make a fine snack, but they should have called them something else, as I'm sure many will be disappointed.<br /><br />Still, now that I know what they taste like, I might buy them again if they go on sale."
2181,Neutral,Your dog will go through them fast.,"I like that I can stuff treats in the center of them, but my dog's an enthusiastic chewer and she's through with this in no time.  I order them occasionally for a little variety."
2182,Neutral,the same as everything,"These are good treats, but I can not say that they are any better than any other. They are bassically the same as any average treat."
2183,Neutral,not worth it,"Why would a huge plastic container of round cheese balls be selling for over 20 dollars?  Are you kidding me?  And the worst part is that the regular cheese curls are a thousand times crunchier and tastier anyway.  Cheese balls taste rather hard and lack the cheesy flavor in comparison to the actual curls.  Either way expect cheese stains all over your hands, and especially the furniture and Nintendo equipment (including TV and Wii remotes) in the living room.  A product that I fail to see why anyone would consider purchasing considering the many flaws."
2184,Neutral,My Dog Devoured this in About a Minute,"I was hoping this would be a great chew for my dog's teeth, along the line of a bullystick. She's not much of a chewer, but I hoped the flavor would entice her to spend some time gnawing on this. But this isn't really designed for that. It's very crispy and breaks down quickly. While she loved the flavor of this--Tripe--she devoured the whole thing in less than a minute, negating the use of this as an aid in caring for her teeth. For my purposes, I don't think I'd buy it again. But if you're just looking for a tasty treat for your dog, this may be for you."
2185,Neutral,very hard,"These will be great for my daughter when she's over a year old or so, but at 11 months, she is not quite ready for something this large and crunchy.  They don't dissolve easily like the Gerber lil crunchies or puffs and I had to dig a whole wagon wheel out of her mouth so she wouldn't choke because she put the whole thing in there and it just sat there without dissolving, even using her teeth and gums to try to mash them.  They are about the size of a quarter so I tried cutting them up into cheerio size pieces but they still just sit on her tongue and don't dissolve and she has a hard time swallowing even the smaller pieces.  I bought a bunch in bulk so I will save them for when she's a little older.  I just wanted other parents to be careful what ages these wagon wheels are fed to."
2186,Neutral,Great product but I don't like the packaging,I love these and my 8 month old loves them but I don't think the product canister does a good job of keeping them fresh.  It seems like they go stale VERY fast.  I don't think the baby cares but since I eat them with her it bothers me.
2187,Neutral,Some are too big!,"My son is now 9 months old, he has been eating finger foods for a few months now. We first purchased the Gerber Graduates Mild Cheddar & he loves them! They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!"
2188,Neutral,Mixed Review for Mix Flower Bouquet,"I ordered two bouguets for two different members of my family for Easter.  The first order was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.  Flowers were gorgeous (or so I was told).<br /><br />The second order was also delivered promptly (apparently), but FEDEX did not ring the doorbell or knock to deliver them.  Instead, they left the flowers on a not-too-often-used porch in 20 degree Michigan weather.  They were discovered 2 days later - in poor condition.<br /><br />My parents were home all day - both of them.  If FedEx had tried to notify them of the delivery, someone would have heard them.<br /><br />No refund was granted by the company.<br /><br />I believe the company has beautiful flowers, but the use of FEDEX as the delivery service failed them in this case.  I will not purchase from any flower company in the future that uses FedEx or UPS.  I will choose a company that uses a local florist shop for delivery.  A local florist shop will call if they are unable to deliver.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that Falcon Farms did not offer to replace the flowers or issue a refund."
2189,Neutral,The picture is nicer than the real Bouquet,"This seems to be always the trouble with flowers. They look so nice<br />on the picture but in reality the bouquet looks small and not so impressive.<br />Still, it looked nice, nothing grand but OK."
2190,Neutral,Back to Nature Spirals & white Cheddar dinner,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1SW8"">Back to Nature Spirals & White Cheddar Dinner, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> I would have liked a cheesier taste even in white cheese.  This is like having alfredo sauce and for those that like Alfredo it would be great."
2191,Neutral,Good but not worth the price,"Just like Breanna I ordered this coffee a while back when it was $.40 a cup.  I enjoy the Hazelnut as well as the Breakfast Blend.  I would be willing to buy this coffee again but not at the current price of a dollar something per cup, that's ridiculous.  There are a lot of K Cups out there for cheaper that are as of similiar quality."
2192,Neutral,Good coffee but that price,"Picked this up other other day for MUCH much cheaper, like .40 a cup now they are 1.19 a cup.<br /><br />I like the flavor and smell of these.  I came back to order again but a buck a piece I'm passing, it's not That good."
2193,Neutral,Overpriced but delicious,"This is my favorite K cup coffee I've tried so far.  I thought it was over priced and then I had to pay shipping so it won't be one I buy often.  When you add the cost of shipping this is a very expensive coffee.  5 stars for the product, 1 star for the price, so I'll give it 3."
2194,Neutral,Shin Bib Bowl Soup,"This product is like a cousin of the famous college era ramen noodles.  The seasoning packet is spicy so if you don't care for a hot tongue, it would pay you to only use half of the powder or eliminate it altogether.  Also, since it is in it's own container, it is easy to add cooked vegetables and/or meat to make it a more robust meal."
2195,Neutral,Hold back some spice!,"Easy to make and substantial in size, the Big Bowl Noodle is a decent lunch option.<br /><br />One caveat- you might not want to add the entire spice packet.  I like spicy food, but the full contents of the spice envelope created a noodle bowl hotter than I could enjoy."
2196,Neutral,Well... Unexpected Thing is inside of the bowl.,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:13 Mins<br /><br /></span>Well... I''m a huge fan of nongshim products since I was a little boy.<br />This is the first time to have this kind of thing ever.<br />I poured some hot water and waited for 3 min.<br />Then, I found some weird black things so I poured everything inside of the bowl.<br />Here's some pictures of the empty inside of the bowl.<br />Unfortunately, even though I contacted the customer service to verify what they are, they did not manage my case well, which means they didn't verify & solve the case but just stop responding me back.<br />Anyway, I hope somebody knows what they are or gets some helpful information to choose the right product.<br /><br />Even though I got this kind of thing from nong shim, it's hard to avoid eating nongshim products so I will order them again & again.<br />I know it's kinda contradict thoughts but I will buy them again and that's why I gave three star instead of one star. :)"
2197,Neutral,Should be complete,"Makes great tasting pancakes.<br /><br />But it should be a ""complete"" mix.  Meaning all you add is water.  It requires eggs/milk/butter/pumpkin puree.  Heck, all they added to generic pancake mix was some spices & a sprinkle of oatmeal flakes.  I expect more from a $9 box of pancake mix."
2198,Neutral,NOT MEGA,"THESES SO CALLED MEGA SIZE SMARTIES ARE THE SAME AS THE GIANT SIZE AND THE GIANT SIZE SELLS FOR LESS. I HAVE HAD SMARTIES WAY LARGER THAN THIS. DISAPPOINTED, DON'T BE FOOLED BUT THEY DO TASTE GREAT. THE MEGA IS IN THE LENGTH OF THE ROLL NOT THE SIZE OF THE CANDY, THE CANDY IS LARGE"
2199,Neutral,Difficult to cook,I had a very difficult ime getting a plate of these to puff up. Not as good as other brands that are in self contained bags that super heat the chips.
2200,Neutral,Average at Best,"The ProFlowers One Dozen Long Stemmed Fancy Roses Red Roses arrived promptly, but their quality is disappointing. You can buy better quality red roses for half the price at local supermarkets, Costco, or Sam's Club.  If you can live with the inconvenience of driving to buy flowers in person, you'll have better results."
2201,Neutral,NOT SO GOOD,"The roses arrived days early. That's the good news.<br />The bad news is that the glass vase that comes with the flowers was shattered into a million pieces, and I spent an hour shaking tiny shards of broken glass out of the roses. Cut myself twice."
2202,Neutral,Not bad...,"This was the first Nong Shim Bowl Noodle product that I've had and based on the reviews for their other products, I was a bit disappointed. While there is no argument that this is better than cup of noodle, it isn't worth paying 6 times as much. Also the ridiculously high sodium content will deter me from buying this again."
2203,Neutral,Could be much better,"These are no where near as flavorful as some of the other Nong Shim products. They might taste better with some additions, but really you'd be better off picking a completely different flavor. Their spicy seafood is delicious, but these are no where near that in terms of flavor. I won't be purchasing these again."
2204,Neutral,Where's the Lobster?...,"As Asian cup n noodles go, these are great. Full of flavor and super quick.  The problem is, I didn't get any lobster flavor at all.  The good things is, it still tasted great."
2205,Neutral,Bad ingredients but decent bone,"I wish the first two ingredients in this bone were not sugar and wheat flour....<br /><br />However, the bone is great in that my dog works on it for a long time, it's not as messy as some of the other bones out there and i'm not worried about him choking on a tendon or bone shard like some of the natural bones.<br /><br />Now i wish some of these larger companies would be more responsible with what they put in their bones!  I give it three points for the ""junk food"" factor."
2206,Neutral,To Big,This product was to big for my dogs and will not purchase again just due to size the product is fabulous and my dogs love the medium size.
2207,Neutral,Lakshmi Jaggery,Received notification it was sent along with the USPS number but never got it. I e-mailed and they responded promptly. They sent out another one--- but the bag had no label and was torn.
2208,Neutral,Eh,"The flavor is great, but it lasts a depressingly short while. The hard case makes it easy to bring some with you all the time, great for sharing with bros. I bought this to fill the $25 requirement for free shipping, next time that happens I'll try something else, just because of the short flavor life."
2209,Neutral,Mentos Sugar Free Gum - Tropical Flavor,"Mentos Sugar Free Gum - Tropical Flavor: Good taste, convenient packaging with no need to unwrap each piece of gum, expensive. Most importantly, the flavor doesn't last as long as the others."
2210,Neutral,Nicely presented but skimpy on the food,"I sent this to my Dad for his birthday.  He said the basket was beautiful and he really appreciated the way it looked.  However, he said that the snacks were nice, but there weren't enough of each.  For instance, he said there were only 5 pistachios!  I don't know if he was exaggerating, but it would be nicer if Dad were satisfied with the food - he has never made this complaint about a gift basket before (and I send him one every year or so)."
2211,Neutral,Asi-Asi,"It was worth a try.  It's good, but not as good as I thought it would be for the price.<br /><br />I've heard people rave about this brand of coffee, so maybe I got a mediocre batch."
2212,Neutral,Great no caffine tea...but,"It is difficult to find. I do not know how many boxes you get from Amazon, but the price is over 100.00."
2213,Neutral,read a newb's opinion,"This is the first kind of yerba mate I ever purchased. I bought it at my grocery store, in the organic section. I didn't know what to expect. It is green and the size of the particles varies greatly. Some of it is actually a powder, and it sometimes seeps out of the infuser as you're brewing it. There are pieces of stem and the leaves are not cut to a uniform size.<br /><br />When you brew it, you need an infuser with a very fine mesh, and you can't submerge the infuser since stuff will leak out where it closes. You want a cylindrical infuser that opens at the top, and make sure the top of the infuser is not submerged. Don't try one of those round ones that closes like 2 halves of an egg, unless you want particles in your drink. There are special gourd things you're supposed to use, but I haven't tried those.<br /><br />Find a good place to let the infuser drain. It will leave a dark green stain on whatever it sits on while it drains. This stain will probably wash out, but you need to watch out for it. If you spill any of the powdery particles of th dry mix, and then if they get wet, they will make the same kind of stain.<br /><br />Having said all of this, I liked the taste and I used up two 16 oz. packages of this in just a short while. I looked around for a cheaper option and tried another brand."
2214,Neutral,"Good taste, clogged bombilla","The flavor of this tea is good, but there are better. Also, it contained a lot of twigs and tiny leaf fragments that frequently clogged my bombilla. My favorite brand is Mate Factor. Eco Teas is cheaper and still very good. And they don't clog my bombilla :)"
2215,Neutral,Very weak flavor,"It arrived on time and was as advertised. My only issue is with the product itself. It is a really, really mild blend. I prefer the bolder mate's. However it may make a nice TERER&Eacute;"
2216,Neutral,Overated,"I disappointed after trying..was expecting this to be as good or better than Maine Roots, Cock & Bulls, or Big Bens ginger brand drinks..not even close on spice. This was a letdown"
2217,Neutral,Shark-o-licious,"Mild watermelon flavor, nice energy boost before training or just in the late afternoon at work.  A little greasy.  Perfect snack for Shark Week : )"
2218,Neutral,Make sure you taste these locally before ordering a 12 pack!,I love Amy's foods but the taste of these beans are not my favorite. They taste way different than other refried black bean companies. I think its that they are sweeter? Not sure but make sure you like the flavor before ordering. I just assumed I would and now I am forcing 12 cans of beans down my throat that I don't really care for.<br /><br />Nothing against Amy's or these beans. Just preference.
2219,Neutral,Not so great,"So, I am a candied fruit slice fanatic, so please consider that I am extra picky in this category of candy.  My ideal fuit slice is one in which the rind (the part outside that thin sugar, white line) is really aldente, the fruit is somewhat dry and which provides some resistance to my teeth.  I found these to be, in general, too wet and too soft.  Perhaps I could have let them dry out in the air and get a little stale but I didn't try that.  I think, instead, I will try another brand."
2220,Neutral,Bad Batch??,In all fairness this is the first time I've had a problem with the Chicken & Mackerel.  I'm hoping I just received a bad batch.  Watery consistency and chunks of darker meat which I can't quite make out.  Pet Food Direct contacted by Nature Organics and was told that there hasn't been a recipe change so I'm going to give it one more chance since this is my cats' favorite flavor.  Pet Food Direct customer service was great in that they refunded the three cases I had purchased.
2221,Neutral,"Love root beer, but if you can find locally, it's cheaper!","I agree with other reviewers - this is the BEST root beer, in my opinion.  A&W doesn't taste right too me, especially when I compare it to this.  A nice big iced glass of Barq's with extra foam on the top - YUM!!  BUT, isn't this a little expensive?  It could be worse, I'm sure, but you can get soda on sale for like 3 for $12 or less, plus you don't have to pay shipping.  So, I gave it 3 stars for the price, not the product.  If you can't find it in your area, than it's worth paying a little more for sure!"
2222,Neutral,Japanese Sencha by Harney & Sons.,"Lol, I just posted a review of Ito En Oi Ocha tea. This tea tastes like water from boiled spinach. Sorry, I'm pretty sure, even the used tea bags were mushy and stunk like spinach. If I were certain that this stuff could cure an ailment I'd buy it. I'm off to try this stuff... <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00170NWEI"">Rishi Tea, Green Tea Sencha, 2.11-Ounce Tin</a>"
2223,Neutral,Great Flavor but Bottle Top Hassle,"I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle."
2224,Neutral,Best alternative to a raw diet,"This is the best alternative to feeding your dog a natural raw diet.<br />But it is WAY over priced. You can make your own raw diet for less than $1 a pound. Sorry but $10+/lb is not a good bargain. You can buy human grade cuts of raw fresh meat for WAY less than that. Even Lamb.<br />Good philosophy, not practical."
2225,Neutral,"Great food, but don't buy it here.","The food is great, but the bag that I got from amazon seemed very stale - half of it was smashed to powder, and you can get a better pricess elsewhere."
2226,Neutral,"Small box, too expensive for what you actually get.","This is one of those situations where you really need to look at what you're ordering. I was expecting a large box of cookies but instead got this tiny 5 ounce box with a handful of macaroons in it.<br /><br />My fault, because it DOES say it's a 5 ounce box but it's not in the product name, features, or description, you have to scroll down to the shipping weight (5 ounces) to see that, or zoom in and read the box.<br /><br />The price is way too high for the amount of macaroons you actually get so be warned that unless you only plan on eating one macaroon at a time you're pretty much buying this for a one-time snack (maybe there's 10 macaroons in the box) and for the price? It's not worth it in my opinion and especially not with the shipping cost.<br /><br />On the taste side the macaroons are good (if you like macaroons but if you don't you shouldn't be buying this anway) but be warned that they are sweetened with maltitol which can have a laxative effect if you eat too many but in my opinion and experience there's not really enough in one box to cause that problem.<br /><br />I give 3 stars because technically if you read what you're buying there should be no surprises and the macaroons DO taste like macaroons even with the zero carb aspect so I can't complain too much because had I read the page thoroughly I would have known what I was getting myself into. But I also would not have purchased the product.<br /><br />There are better low carb snack products out there so unless you REALLY like macaroons and feel like spendg 75 cents for each one (which is roughly the size of an average strawberry) it's probably not worth it."
2227,Neutral,Something different...,"These are not the typical Caesar salad croutons, but nevertheless, still very tasty.<br /><br />The ingredients:<br /><br />- Not overly salted so the herbs really contribute to the flavor.<br /><br />- The amount of garlic is OK, so your loved ones do not have to eat these croutons along with you to bear your presence :-)<br /><br />- No dubious ""natural"" flavors were used.<br /><br />- The package states ""Product of Israel"", so the herbs really seem to come from a Mediterranean climate.<br /><br />- The size of the croutons is on the smaller side so they can readily absorb the dressing. Very important for me, since I am usually a little bit in a hurry when I prepare my meals.<br /><br />On the obvious downside is the long transportation distance from the manufacturer to the US, which is usually a bit disturbing for consumers of organic products. I also couldn't find a ""Best before..."" info on the package.<br /><br />Overall still a nice crouton variety."
2228,Neutral,Real peppermint,"A natural gum with real peppermint flavoring, not that fake stuff in commercial gums."
2229,Neutral,My dog only likes the filling,"My dog Ewok enjoys these Dingos very much...for about 1 day. As soon as he has chewed all the red filling out, leave all the tiny pieces all over my apartment and inside my rug, he is done with it. He does seem to enjoy it immensely so I am giving it 3 stars."
2230,Neutral,Bland,"I'm a vegetarian, and generally a fan of Amy's stuff, but <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G18NSE"">Amy's Organic Medium Chili with Vegetables, 14.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> tasted bland to me. I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant of spices. I usually get the medium salsa in the store, for example. A little extra seasoning helped, and I got out the mildly spicy chips to go with it.<br /><br />Although I didn't think it was spicy enough, it certainly was easy to make (heat it up), and it was a healthy alternative to the food I normally fix when I am in a hurry. I think I will try the spicy version of it instead."
2231,Neutral,"Son loves, but too spicy for me..","I've had to keep my son supplied with this product for years.  As for my own taste, I really wish there was a mild version. (It only comes in medium and spicy.)"
2232,Neutral,"Not good, not bad","I've been looking for a good canned chili that I can prepare quickly and easily. I love Amy's Chunky Tomato Bisque, so figured I'd try the Chili. Dummy me, I didn't look close enough at the can so I didn't realize it was Vegan. But, really, when it says ""Chili, WITH VEGETABLES"", why would I assume it was ALL vegetable?<br /><br />In any case, I would have expected a good vegan chili to make me not even notice the lack of meat in the chili. I just found it predominantly bland."
2233,Neutral,Cakes were ok,One of the 10 in the case was bad . The other 9 were fine. I have reordered again. waiting on it to arrive
2234,Neutral,Underwhelming,"I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn't taste like much.  The organic cocoa powder doesn't seem to mix well, and the hemp...well, it's hemp, got a funny taste to it -- though nowhere near as intense and malodorous as that emanating from the company's Hemp Pro 70 line!  Anywhere, this one is okay.  If you want a plant-based protein from what seems to be a ""progressive"" company, this is probably the way to go.  Just understand that the taste is at best tolerable, even with cocoa powder and sugar among the ingredients!  That's how awful hemp tastes...."
2235,Neutral,Manitoba Dark Chocolate Hemp Powder,"This is very grainy and chalky like most other hemp powders I've tried. The taste is fine ( I like chocolate better than other flavors) but I also mix it with vanilla hemp milk, coconut milk, chocolate milk, or whatever else I feel like adding that morning. Tastes don't bother me as much as textures do so if you're like me then the grainy/chalky feel of this is going to be too much on it's own. I have to mix it up with the Nutiva brand hemp powder to smooth it out a little and make it stretch (because Nutiva is more expensive) but is the best that I've had so far.<br /><br />This is pretty much what I was expecting though and you have to remember it is a HEALTH shake and it isn't going to taste fantastic but you can do a lot to alter it more to your liking. If I actually used a real blender and added fruit and honey and some things like that to it the graininess could probably be cut down but I'm lazy and don't have time in the mornings to do that and I'm fine with what I do."
2236,Neutral,"Good product, wish for a better seller though...","The product arrived on time and was the correct flavor type. There was a problem though; when I opened the brown shipping box, it looked like whoever shipped it opened up my product and took out one of the pouches (it was a 12-pouch pack, the kind you would set up in a grocery store). I also ordered a different flavor at the same time from the same company, and that box was also missing a pouch. So in total, I was screwed out of 2 pouches of gum. I didn't bother sending the product back or complaining because let's face it, the trouble wasn't worth the $2 that the gum was worth. But still, kind of disappointing that someone would steal from their customer."
2237,Neutral,"Good jerky, too much pepper!!","The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!"
2238,Neutral,"Not a good value, but tasty","The packs are really small. I thought I was saving by buying in bulk, but it was not a lot for the money.  As usually the beef jerkey tastes great."
2239,Neutral,"Delicious, BUT it contains MSG!","If you're not into a healthy lifestyle, get these - they are DELICIOUS! ""You can't eat just one!""<br />It contains MSG and other ""stuff."" - You've been warned! It's very delicious, though..."
2240,Neutral,"Good, healthy and protein filled snack.",I only have one major issue. Because of the texture of jerky in general it really gets stuck in your teeth and becomes a bit of a chore to eat.
2241,Neutral,Cheaper at Walmart,"Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free."
2242,Neutral,Great product but the subscription ships old products.,"I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again."
2243,Neutral,As expected,"This was an impulse buy. I purchased other food items and decided to try getting this from Amazon. I later found that the same product was much cheaper at my local Big Box Membership Warehouse store. The jerky was about the same freshness as I find in local stores. I was hoping for fresher, ie softer jerky."
2244,Neutral,Good flavor but a bit tough,I really like the flavor of these but they are a bit tougher than I am used to.  I dont think I will be buying them again.
2245,Neutral,"If you like Jack Links, then this is a great deal","You can count on Jack Links to provide a tasty, consistent-quality product. This Mega Pack is a great value, too. Still, I try to purchase smaller, boutique brands whenever possible. But they are becoming increasingly difficult to find. So Jack Links can definitely fill the bill.<br /><br />Recommended."
2246,Neutral,Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy,"I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links."
2247,Neutral,Half what you ordered.,"This is supposed to be ""Sweet & HOT"" beef jerky.  It's sweet, but it's not HOT.  It's not even hot.  If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT."
2248,Neutral,Jacks Jerky,"There is decent value in the product and the packaging is first rate. However, the jerky is almost rock hard making it difficult to chew."
2249,Neutral,Cheaper else where,"I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!"
2250,Neutral,Healthy? Yes. Crunchy? You betcha. Tasty? Sort of....,"My last purchase of raw pumpkin seeds was from a different seller/brand and they were delicious. I went with this brand this time, mainly due to the price. The reason these are much less flavorful is because they have NO SALT. I understand that salt is unhealthy in large amounts, but I dont have a heart condition (yet) and I like a little salt on nuts.<br /><br />The seller needs to include important info like that so that people can know what they are getting. I will of course eat these, and they would go great in home made trail mix, but I will be salting the ones I eat by themselves."
2251,Neutral,"Expensive, but it worked!","I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all."
2252,Neutral,Meh,"I bought this for my cat, who suddenly started vomiting on a daily basis. No rhyme or reason for it either, not hairballs, or some kind of illness. This didn't help the vomiting issue and considering the cost of the food and composition, I've since switched her to a product richer in proteins that costs a similar amount and actually seems to have quickly cleared up the problem."
2253,Neutral,Way more expensive per pound than the larger-sized bags of the same food,"I posted my review for the quality of this cat food here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MWBFXY"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach Dry Cat Food - 15.5-Pound Bag</a>, which is the same food as this but in a larger bag.  Here, I just wanted to point out that this smaller size bag is actually much more expensive.  As of the date I'm writing this, this 3.5-pound bag costs $3.71 per pound, whereas the 7-pound bag costs $3.50 per pound and the 15.5-pound bag costs $2.32 per pound.  So you pay over 50% more per pound for this size compared with the largest size.  Just wanted to point this out in case it could save anyone money!  I like the cat food a lot."
2254,Neutral,Too large for cats,"This food may be good for my cats, but two of my ragdolls, and these are large cats, will not eat the chunks because they are so large."
2255,Neutral,Not tastey,"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try."
2256,Neutral,stringy,sweet and delicious - but very stringy.  We have asparagus every day for health and the strings are unappealing.  Maybe I'll take a pass next time.
2257,Neutral,"Not what I'd hoped, but it'll do","I have several recipes which call for chicken broth, but I am now on a low-sodium diet.  Fat-Free/50%Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth (such as College Inn) still has 450mg of sodium per 1 cup and I use 2-3 cups per recipe... and that total amount is unacceptable for me.  My only other recourse would have been to make my own chicken stock  (and I'm simply not that motivated lol)<br /><br />This product is a good substitute for chicken broth in recipes if you're on a low sodium diet, however, it does not have the taste of traditional canned chicken broth.  As another reviewer mentioned, it has an overwhelming celery seed taste/smell to it (although, oddly enough, celery is not listed as an ingredient).  I haven't tried the Wyler's sodium free version so I don't know how it compares flavor-wise and as far as I know there is no sodium free chicken version from Knorr.<br /><br />The price is good for the amount you get - much less expensive in the long run than buying the 8 packets box, though you might want to try a box first to see if you like the taste before committing to Amazon's pack of 6 jars.  I gave this 3 stars because while it works for recipes which call for chicken broth and I'm glad to have a sodium free version, I couldn't say it was a very good-tasting broth.  It'll do.<br /><br />For those of you who are counting:  1 tsp. bouillon to 1 cup water = 1 cup broth.  According to the label, each jar makes 26 cups and it is Gluten free, no MSG.  There are 10 calories per cup, 0 sodium, 0 trans-fat, 1 gram sugar."
2258,Neutral,I WANT to love it,"The pros:  Herb Ox is the only sodium-free bouillon I've been able to find that is both salt and MSG free.  Also, this larger size is not usually available in stores.  The cons:  The broth this bouillon makes tastes like celery.  Not celery and chicken, not celery and onion, not even celery and pepper.  Just...celery.  I know that a sodium-free bouillon is not going to taste anything like regular chicken bouillon, but try as I might I could not find any semblance of chicken flavor in this whatsoever.  I am a soup addict and am trying to eliminating as much salt from my diet as possible, so I REALLY wanted to love this product.  I will still use it and hope against hope that I develop some kind of taste (or tolerance) for it.  Perhaps I can doctor it with garlic powder and make it a little more flavorful.  For me personally, at this point the only purpose I think this will serve for me is a milder version of celery seed."
2259,Neutral,"Crunchy and satisfying, but too high in sodium. :(","Picked up a box of Kellogg's Special K cracker chips (Sea Salt variety) today at the grocery store (I did not buy from Amazon).  They also come in at least one other flavor that I saw--Sour Cream and Onion.<br /><br />Taste and Texture:  They are crunchy, potatoey and a little on the thick side compared to most potato chips.  I was reminded of the look and texture of Munchos with a flavor combo of Munchos and Pringles.  They are small and round (about the size of a Ritz cracker) and have a bit of a scoop shape.<br /><br />Being hypertensive and not a big salt user, my palate tends to be sensitive to over-salty foods.  I found these chips appropriately salty to my tastebuds, so they may not be salty enough for a true salt junky.<br /><br />Nutrition Information:  I compared the nutrition facts on these cracker chips to the brand of potato chips I usually buy--Utz Natural 40% Reduced Fat Kettle Cooked.  The serving size on the Special K chips is 30 chips (30 grams) whereas the Utz serving size is 20 chips at 28 grams--not exactly the same, but close.  Here is how they stack up nutritionally when put head-to-head:<br /><br />Utz 40% Reduced Fat Chips<br /><br />Calories  130<br />Total Fat  6g<br />Sat Fat  0.5g<br />Sodium  75mg<br />Total carbs  18g<br />Fiber  1g<br />Sugars  0g<br />Protein  2g<br /><br />Special K Cracker Chips<br /><br />Calories  110<br />Total Fat  2.5<br />Sat Fat  0<br />Sodium  230mg<br />Total carbs  23g<br />Fiber  3g<br />Sugars  &lt;1g<br />Protein  2g<br /><br />So Special K wins on calories (minimally), total fat (substantially), sat fat (minimally) and fiber, but loses on sodium (substantially), carbs and sugar.<br /><br />While I found the Special K cracker chips enjoyable, I do not find them nutritionally superior enough (and definitely not superior enough in taste and texture) to the chips I'm already eating to switch, especially when I only buy a bag or two of chips per month and when the Special K cracker chips have 3 times the sodium of my regular chips.  However, if you are looking for something with less total fat, and sodium isn't going to be a health problem for you, then the Special K product may be for you."
2260,Neutral,illy Caffe Scuro Espresso pods,"Coffee was good, but not quite as good as the price would have led me to believe.  But then again, all the coffees of this kind, including the pods have gotten very expensive and takes away from the convenience of using them.  For a special occasion, it is fine, but for everyday use, I would try an alternative."
2261,Neutral,Adequate but not like properly done fresh ground and tamped.,"Nice, convenient, adequate taste and freshness. However, no substitute for real freshly ground, properly tamped and brewed espresso."
2262,Neutral,"Good Product, Expires TOO Soon","Received this product on 20Jan11, Expires 20Mar11 (`60-days). Now I know that it is 'Organic' and should not contain the normal preservative 'junk' that other foods contain, but shouldn't it expire (proper storage considered (cool/dry place etc) to be common sense) more than 60-days from date of receipt? I feel that we received product that was FIFO, which is good warehousing, IF the product has any chance of being consumed within a REASONABLE time period. For my family, 60-days is NOT reasonable for 6 bags of flour, not sure I know who that would be reasonable for short of a retail food store.<br /><br />Since I cannot leave Vendor Feedback, which would not be over 3 stars, I want to say that upon my contact with Amazon Customer Service (yes, it DOES exist) I was treated well and the situation was somewhat solved, clearly to my satisfaction. Thanks Amazon! I just wish that Amazon was that helpful when I had my DIRECTV Store opened with them as a Vendor!<br /><br />Thanks for listening and be sure to inquire about the expiration date before you buy."
2263,Neutral,used by date is too soon.,"flour is great. very tasteful and works great with all kind of gluten free recipes.<br />it also add boost flavor when you use it with pork food and baking goods.<br />But how you gonna use 6pack of soy flour in a month??<br />since i'm a person who doesn't like to throw food away, i did share these with my neighbors.<br />well.. unless you gonna share with someone or have big family, i wouldn't recommend to buy big portion of it."
2264,Neutral,Not to bad for Alaska,"It's been a long time since I had smoked salmon and this was good for me and since it came in separate boxes , I was able to share. thank you"
2265,Neutral,Could be better- very strong tea!,"I like to drink herbal tea every once in a while as a break from coffee.  I love Mint Medley tea bags, but it doesn't work so well in k-cup form.  It seems to come out very strong, so I add more hot water in (which kind of defeats the pupose)!  My Keuring brewer can only make an 8 oz. cup.  If your brewer can make a 10 or 12 oz. mug, this tea would probably be worth a try.  I'm sure personal taste preference is also a factor here."
2266,Neutral,"Not ""minty"" enough","This tea is not ""minty"" enough. I have Stash Peppermint tea bags and they are so much stronger."
2267,Neutral,Sweet Leaf vs Kal,"In my opinion the Kal products are superior tasting to the Sweet Leaf. The product is good, but not as after taste free as the Kal."
2268,Neutral,Bahlsen Truffet cookies,I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt.
2269,Neutral,Too pricy,After receiving the Nido from Amazon and seeing the size of the containers I was able to find it in my local grocery for over $2.00 less per container and there was no shipping involved.
2270,Neutral,Instant Whole MIlk,"It is a good replacement for the ""Milkman"" product I used to buy, that is no longer available. I'm not sure of the economics of buyoing it online and paying for the shipping."
2271,Neutral,"Maybe okay for cooking but its a poor substitute for drinking, and its expensive","When you do the math, this works out to about $6.65 per gallon.  I use it in coffee and tea and it works great for that but recently I made up a glass for my father-in-law and he didnt care for the taste.  Granted, we didnt measure per the directions because they were given in grams and ml but I would guess that it wouldnt matter anyway.  Also, it wasnt sufficient just to mix with a spoon, we had to put it in a shaker to get it perfectly blended.  Im not sure how it is with cereal but if you're not cooking and you're going to be consuming more than just a bit for coffee and tea, I would suggest just buying milk at the grocery store.  Shelf life turned out to be just 1 yr and 2 months because the cans sent were packaged about 8 months prior to shipping out."
2272,Neutral,Date-filled cookies,"This was a gift for my father, while he was in a temporary nursing home, which he shared with the others in the home. It was a success."
2273,Neutral,"Pretty Nice for a Light Soup--still salty enough for flavor, hardly any beef (no surprise)","This is a soup on the ""fluid-ey"" side (not thick). Lots of broth, some veggies, some barley, almost no beef. Granted, you shouldn't expect a ton of stuff in a ""light"" and lower calorie version of soup.<br /><br />For dieters, not much caloric damage. For those who enjoy the combo of beef and barley in a tomatoey broth, here ya go. The main veggies are carrots and celery, but you find peas and green beans and bits of tomato, too. Eighty (80) calories per serving. Pretty good.<br /><br />For folks watching carbs, it's 14 carbs per serving. Just skip the crackers. ; )<br /><br />If you aren't low-carb: Add some crisp and light Wasa crackers and Jarlsberg Lite, and it's a comforting, satisfying lunch without too many calories (hubby had this today).<br /><br />I would buy this again.<br /><br />Note: Updated to say that,  no, I wouldn't buy this again, but that's cause I avoid gluten these days, and that means avoid barley, wheat. etc. :)"
2274,Neutral,These are roasted,"The description did not specify raw or roasted but another reviewer stated they were unroasted.  We were surprised when they arrived that they are indeed roasted.  This should be made clear in item details.  Also, the foil was not fully sealed on one of the jars."
2275,Neutral,Handy but not to tasty,This tea is not so tasty in my opinion. But one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree.
2276,Neutral,Trying this product for the first time,"I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price."
2277,Neutral,Just had a glass today,"When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)"
2278,Neutral,Makes great drinks but you have to use a lot!,"This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected."
2279,Neutral,Not bad.  A bit light.,"I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea."
2280,Neutral,Organic not so great,I've been on the hunt for the perfect cup of tea for the past year...Assam blend/malt flavor in particular.  Was disappointed when I tried this as it didn't provide the desired taste.  This was my second attempt at 'organic assam' tea (by different manufacturer) and the 'organic' actually seems to make it taste worse??!  I recently landed on Yorkshire Gold and I'm extremely satisfied (combination of Assam and other blends but still excellent).
2281,Neutral,Packaging leaves much to be desired.,"This order reached me quickly.<br /><br />I opened up the box to see two packages of the box in the same package. In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.<br /><br />Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.<br /><br />Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good. Again, in hindsight, I shouldn't have gotten a 100-count box. Ah well. I don't think I'll purchase this particular product again, and I'll more than likely give the second tea box away to someone else."
2282,Neutral,I anxiously awaited it..and then it was just not quite 'it'..,"I had this tea in my cart for awhile and then it became unavailable, so I waited for it to come back in stock as this sounded like a nice tea.<br /><br />I have been enjoyed the Celestial Seasonings White Tea with Pear that I got on Amazon and so I anxioulsy anticipated this new tea.<br /><br />However, in drinking it, I'm not all that crazy about it. To me, it tastes like a black tea; I hardly taste the ginger at all, and it's not as pepperminty as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I realize tastes are just so personal, but that's how I view it anyway.<br /><br />Oh, you should know that it comes in a regular box (as pictured) and not in a tea box at all. So, you will want a cannister, tea tin, or something to put it in.<br /><br />In the meantime, I do like the White Tea with Pear.."
2283,Neutral,"Same price as stores, lesser product","I am a fan of the double bergamot stash earl grey from stores in packs of 18.  This bulk box does not contain the same quality product.  I don't know if it just sits around too long, or my order contained an off-season batch, but when you can go to target and get the same 100 bags for about $1 more than the subscribe and save price for a better product, why buy in bulk?"
2284,Neutral,Not as Peachy as the Black Tea,"If you like peach teas, this is not the one for you.  The peach flavor is lost and it tastes more like an Oolong tea.  I would recommend the Peach Black Tea by Stash instead."
2285,Neutral,Has STASH tea become weaker in flavor?,"It how takes three to four tea bags and steeping for at least half hour for me to get a large mug of licorice spice tea.  This was always my favorite tea, however I have noticed a decline in the strength over the last year or two.  However, the price is right."
2286,Neutral,"Not full bodied as Twining Irish, Won't buy again",Stash has good green tea's but personally i wasn't impressed with Irish Black Tea. It is weak compared to other's i have tried like Yorkshire or Twinings. This one is not acidic or bad tasting as Lipton but just not full bodied or flavor.
2287,Neutral,short shipped,"I was disappointed to find my tea bags hastily packed in a 6X6x6 shipping box, and only 93 of 100 tea bags. Also this batch of tea almost without any Jasmin taste. In the past my Stash green jasmin tea was better."
2288,Neutral,It's OK,The tea is ok.  It isn't very strong; I want to love Stash teas yet they are very weak in flavor.  One has to use extra tea bags to make the taste come out right.  Why oh why can't they get the flavor right?<br /><br />I want to love this tea yet I cannot because the amount of tea in each bag is so weak!
2289,Neutral,Just OK,Marginally better than Lipton. Don't think I will order it again. Came in a box and I was not really impressed with packaging either.
2290,Neutral,A very mellow peppermint,"I prefer a much fresher peppermint and Stash seems bland or stale to me. For a brisk peppermint, Twinings is far better."
2291,Neutral,Stick with Tazo,This is not really so good. IF you are limited in funds then it is an ok chai. I prefer Tazo and have made cuts in other places to afford the Tazo chai. Stash chai is just not a very balanced flavor. It is to heavy on the cloves which dominates the other flavors
2292,Neutral,"Good, but stale","Each tea bag is wrapped in packaging. The bottom of each says ""Best by 20102014"". Huh? I think this tea is stale. The expiration date is confusing or just meaningless.<br />The tea bags are sent in a shipping box. So, you get 100 tea bags all wadded into a cardboard box with a shipping label stuck on the outside. You will need to put the bags into something else when you receive them. A ziplock bag should be fine."
2293,Neutral,Coconut is more pronounced than mango.,"One of the biggest challenge to mix more than one fruit flavor in tea is to be able to balance the taste and aroma of the two fruits, so the tea doesn't taste and smell like one or the other. I love real mango and coconut, so when I saw this tea displayed in the grocery store, I couldn't wait to try it. I must say I was a little disappointed because after brewing a cup, I immediately noticed only the aroma of the coconut, and the taste of the tea proved it that way as well. Though there are other brands that utilize Mango and do a better job in their flavored tea, I am still happy that I got to know this Stash tea as there aren't that many brands that use the coconut flavor in their tea."
2294,Neutral,Herbal tea,"This flavor was okay. I purchased some black peach tea from this company that I liked much better. I also purchased the acai herbal tea which is okay, but not as good as the peach. It is a good product. I liked that the tea bags came individually wrapped, although the bags were loose in the box."
2295,Neutral,tea review,This tea smells wonderful but I think it needs to be made very strong to get the taste.It helps to add some sweetener.  It was not as rich in taste as I had hoped for.
2296,Neutral,Decent Product,"The taste of the product wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be. There is definitely a strong coconut taste that overpowers the mango taste. I expected more mango in the equation. However, with all expectations put aside, the tea is good."
2297,Neutral,"Decent, not great","This is a great price for individually wrapped peppermint tea, but the flavor is nowhere near as sharp and fresh as Celestial Seasonings or Yogi tea. We'll probably go with those brands in the future."
2298,Neutral,Kinda Disapointed,I've had Stash English breakfast Tea several times. But it has been about two years now since I had it so I ordered 100 from Amazon. I don't know if I got a bad batch but the tea don't seem as good as it use to be. It tastes only a tiny bit better than say Tetley or Lipton. I remember it to be far superior. I just don't know. It's not stale because the expiration date is the end of 2014. I wish I picked another brand.
2299,Neutral,"Decaf. White Tea w/ Raspberry: Simple, Unsophisticated","I ordered this because I enjoy white teas, and decaffeinated white teas are hard to find, which is what I prefer iin the evening.  The taste is simple and clean, which is the goal of a white tea, but is not very exciting.  I would have preferred a slightly more complex, developed taste, but will play with the brewing and see if it improves.  The raspberry is almost non-existent, which is a positive in my mind.  Whenever trying a new tea with fruit flavors, I am nervous that the fruit will be overwhelming, which isn't the case here.<br /><br />While not necessarily a function of the tea itself, I was disappointing that it arrived in a plain cardboard box, with the tea bags just dumped in it.  This is clearly a wholesale lot, divided up for smaller orders on Amazon.  A shoebox full of tea bags everywhere is not very conducive to storage, and I suspect that I am not the only tea drinker that would have appreciated a slight bit of order in the packaging."
2300,Neutral,Poorly packed,"The tea was smushed into the box so badly that a couple of the individual wrappers were damaged and bust open. The box itself had a hole in it. I had read other peoples reviews that said the same. It was so poorly packed I wondered if it was even legit or if someone had just cleaned out their cupboards and stuffed all of their leftover tea bags in a box. Anyhow, I found the double spice too bitter so I won't probably buy it again. The 100 ct Stash tea probably won't tempt me again either due to the careless packaging."
2301,Neutral,Passable but not fantastic,"My wife will tell you that I am a tea snob.  This is an okay breakfast tea, but I'm not in love with it.  It's also not terribly expensive.  It is convenient.  I usually take it with some milk.  It tastes good with milk.  The tea is slightly bitter, not very flavorful, nor memorable.  I have tasted English Breakfast tea by Strand, Adagio, and a couple others.  Adagio's is my favorite.  This is good if you it's the only thing handy.  It's not bad, but it's not good, either.<br /><br />I noticed a few people thought this review unhelpful.  Sorry about that.  I can't recommend this tea.  Maybe you will like it.  If you do, don't go tasting other tea because you might realize how truly mediocre this one is."
2302,Neutral,"Tea Bags are all thrown into a box and get crushed, otherwise a good deal.","This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.<br /><br />The teas I bought this way are good, they get a 3 for how they were just thrown into the box though.  Couldn't they have used a smaller box and lined the bags up in a way they didn't move around?  They ended up with some tea bags fine, others almost in a little ball in the middle!<br /><br />The tea is refreshing though, not high on the mint, but it's great for a summer's day!"
2303,Neutral,"Great product, but caffeine free????","For the price you can't go wrong. It's a great product and excellent quality. My quam is that it claims to be caffeine free, but it sure kept me up all night long after taking it. I'm not quite sure if it really is caffeine free. I bought it to relax before going to bed. I certainly can't do that with this product."
2304,Neutral,"Good deal, but tea bags come all crushed in the box!","This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.

2305,Neutral,pork skin rolls,"Nice chew alternative to rawhide when they are allergic to beef.  I have to say the beagle likes them a lot more than the lab, he tends to let them lay there til last resort.  They both like the really thin pork ties so maybe the rolls are just too thick for the lab."
2306,Neutral,"Very earthy, and a little bitter","Pros:<br />Quick cup of tea<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very earthy<br />Expensive<br />A bit acidy/bitter<br /><br />I enjoy green tea, and have tried a handful of varieties and many forms of it.  I've done the bags, pyramid bags, and loose tea.  This, I have to say, was probably the worst green tea I've had.  It was strong, bitter, and very earthy.  Similar to what happens when you steep certain green teas for too long.  Not sure if this is related to the particular brand, though I think I've had bagged versions of twinings green tea before that were just fine, or if its just the way it is brewed with the t-disc.  Or maybe its just a taste preference thing.  Maybe some people really enjoy a very earthy, and slightly acrid taste. Maybe its the more natural way for green tea to be.  For me, I will stick to my loose teas blended with jasmine or citrus notes.<br /><br />To conclude, if you like a smooth tasting green tea, this is not for you.  If you like your green tea strong, and earthy, this might be up your alley.  I think the price is also very expensive for what you get."
2307,Neutral,"Good Coffee, but not worth the cost","On my visits to Switzerland, I always enjoyed the Nestl&eacute; instant coffee that had a burned taste to it. So when I searched in the internet, I thought I would be able to order the same coffee.<br />I was wrong. Although the coffee I got was good, it was not even as good as Taster's Choice, French Roast, which I can buy here, at 25% of the cost of the coffee I had ordered.<br />It is not the coffee I get from the supermarket in Lausanne. Otherwise the service was impecable, the item I had ordered (Gold Coffee) was received on time, well packaged."
2308,Neutral,I expected a dark roast coffee,This coffee produces a lot of crema and smells wonderful.  It is not a dark roast one.  There is not enough body for me.
2309,Neutral,Ok for the money...,"In fairness, I used a french press with this bean and is advertised as an espresso bean. Not bad, just not great."
2310,Neutral,Lavazza Super Crema,"Great crema and aroma, but a little too mild for me. I expected something better from these beans, but i guess it's all about personal taste and preference."
2311,Neutral,Not what I expected.,"When I first purchased these beans, I had just gotten a Saeco Automatic Espresso Machine...I love the idea of the manual machines, I'm just not prepared to mess with tamping and grinding while I'm trying to get out the door in the morning. I have recently been to Italy and very much enjoyed the Lavazza beans I had there. These are nothing in comparison. The other reviews that said they looked and tasted stale- I have to agree. These beans look extremely dry and the flavor is just not there. Trying to order the Gran Filtro Dark Beans to see if they taste any different. When comparing these ""Premium"" beans to a local roaster...it is night and day. Not what I expected and shame on you Amazon for selling stale beans."
2312,Neutral,Eehhh!,"This coffee wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be.  Just didn't have the flavor or aroma I was expecting.  I use a french press, my preferred method of brewing and that usually brings out the best a coffee has to offer."
2313,Neutral,Not as strong as I would have liked,"When I first received the bag and opened it, I was in heaven. The smell of this coffee is amazing. However, the taste doesn't measure up to the smell.<br /><br />Some background: I love strong coffee and can't stand the thought of putting sugar in it. So far, I have used this coffee in my espresso machine to make cappuccinos.<br /><br />First, let me comment on the crema. I was expecting more. From reading other reviews, I expected the thickest crema I'd ever seen. In fact, the crema is about the same as with most brands of coffee I use in my machine. Depending upon how fine I grind the coffee, how much coffee I use, and how tightly I pack the coffee, the crema is better or worse. This brand didn't make any noticeable difference.<br /><br />From a flavor standpoint, I find this coffee rather weak. It might be okay straight up as espresso, but once I add steamed milk, it's quite watery. I brewed it side by side with Costco's Kirkland Espresso (Starbuck's roast), and the Kirkland brand is much bolder and more intense.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a strong coffee, one with intense flavor, this isn't the coffee for you."
2314,Neutral,Good but expected better,"The coffee is good but not great. The package is supposed to be vacuum packed but this one was not. Seems like leaky vacuum bags are a problem at Lavazza. And I don't know if the coffee would have been better if the package had held the vacuum. In contrast, the Lavazza Dark Roast Arabica is a wonderful daily coffee."
2315,Neutral,espresso review,"I ordered this product based on the reviews in this area. The lavazza super crema is an average espresso. If you like a mild espresso this is the one for you. It produces a rich multi-colored crema for espresso. I like a more robust espresso that has an intense coffee flavor. For those who prefer beans that have that oily sheen, this is not for you. The lavazza is a light colored bean with just a hint of oil on the beans. This would be a better product for plain coffee and not for espresso. If you want deep rich espresso, try Barnies espresso roast."
2316,Neutral,Possibly Stale Beans?,"I have purchased this brand of Lavazza, as well as the Tierra and Gran Riserva.  I use them in my Alex Duetto Espresso Machine (which I couldn't recommend more).  Of these three options, most of which I've tried from several orders, I find the Top Class and Tierra to be the best.  The Super Crema has been the least enjoyable for me, mostly it has been bland.  It's possible I have always received stale Super Crema beans.  I usually make Latte's. I have also had Chris Black Pearl espresso beans and they are quite good for a nice change."
2317,Neutral,Not strong enough for me,"I love Lavazza products.  Crema e Gusto is by far my favorite espresso.  This coffee is okay.  No robust flavor or aroma.  I like my coffee to have a deep rich flavor and this lacks both.  I have a $4000 Miele coffee machine, so it's not my coffee maker.  If you like a very light tasting coffee (although plenty of caffiene) you will like this.  But I'm going to try something bolder."
2318,Neutral,"Good Coffee, No Vacum","I'm a long time consumer of lavazza, however this was the first time i purchased whole beans. I got the whole beans in aim of getting a fresher coffee, this one was described as vacuumed packed and just for $19.09. Unfortunately it was not vacuum packed like I have expected."
2319,Neutral,Not pretending to be an expert but . . . .,"I don't pretend to be an expert or a connoisseur, but I really appreciate good coffee (to my palate at least)I would not touch toasted garbanzo, (ala f*lgers, etc.) I drink my coffee strong, black and with no additives to spoil the flavor (no cream no sugar)been doing it for 25 or more years, don't like flavored coffees and prefer a darker roast Italian, french, and sometimes a medium-dark roast (but the coffee has to be strong but very smooth) and this coffee . . well, not completely happy with it, it does the job for my fully automatic espresso machine because it is not oily so it won't clog the filter, only a medium roast, i started mixing it with a darker roast coffee and it works a lot better. Again it does the job, will try something different. I am curious about the coffee bean direct 6 bean espresso blend."
2320,Neutral,Give it 3.5 Stars,"Can't rave about this coffee as others have. I have two Jura machines. Reg and decaf machines. I am especially fond of a rich smooth espresso or dark roast. Like others have said, it is like wine or anything else. Each of us has individual tastes. For me, this is a ""nice"" cup of coffee. Like you would get in a coffee house or nice restaurant. Not bold and not really the rich espresso I'm used to. Maybe that is what is preferred in Europe, sooooo?? Not sure that impresses me much, not sure why that is even important here.<br />I like this coffee but not ""crazy"" about it. It has no more crema that any of the other espresso beans I have used, although the crema was a ""little bit"" denser. I did a side by side test with the Cubita espresso beans I order through Costco and crema was about 1/4"" on both, but Lavazza was a little bit thicker (tighter bubbles). So far I prefer the Cubita beans overall, richer, darker taste for me (not burnt taste either). Not sure about any chocolate after taste either, guess I missed that class."
2321,Neutral,Delicious but inappropriate for semi-automatic espresso machines,"After reading all the glowing reviews of this coffee, I bought some for my semi-automatic espresso machine. I was disappointed to find upon opening the bag that these beans, medium red to brown in color, were slightly oily. Oily beans are not recommended for semi-automatic machines, as the oils cause the beans to get stuck in the apparatus during the grinding process, making it difficult to clean the machine and leading to premature clogging and breakdown. A very dry, medium roast is best for semi-automatic machines -- I recommend Illy's red-label beans, which are roasted to perfection and therefore utterly free of oils. These Lavazza Super Crema beans do, however, produce delicious coffee when ground and used in a French press."
2322,Neutral,Its Ok but not strong for Capuccino,"Its little lighter than costco espresso blend, I had to make 2 shots espresso drink instead of usual 1 shot.<br />But I drink more like capuccino with milk and sugar.<br />for straight espresso might be strong enough. Hope that helps"
2323,Neutral,Wish I could say I loved it...,"Like a lot of consumers, I purchased this coffee based solely on user reviews on Amazon.  Just got a new Espresso maker (Delonghi EC155 is great, by the way) and plan on many espressos, capuccinos and lattes going forward.<br /><br />First the pros - shipping was very fast, and the pricing on Amazon is unbeatable.  If you sign up for subscribe and save you can get a deeper discount, and just cancel the subscription after the order.  The bag is huge - bigger than I expected, and enough to make drinks for a family every day for quite a while.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I just really don't care for the flavor of this coffee.  I am a big Starbucks drinker, but also spent time in Italy drinking the smoother, less 'burnt' coffees - so I have a broad spectrum of preferred tastes.  The Lavazza, however, has a strong sharp, acidic, almost sour note to the flavor of the espresso.  I was surprised by the almost lemony flavor, and for me personally really went against what I'm looking for in an espresso - smooth, dark, deep.  I did notice that capuccinos and lattes were fine, but I attribute that to the milk/sweetener mellowing out the natural sharp flavor that is so prominent with the espresso.<br /><br />I see some other reviews have made similar comments - but opinions vary quite a bit.  This suggests it's a personal taste thing.  It would be nice if there was a smaller size to try first, but at least the 2.2 pound bag is a great price!"
2324,Neutral,"Good coffee, but...","It is a really good coffee for the money, but it is lightly roasted for espresso. The aroma is really nice, but has little flavour and body. That is why I am giving only three stars for a coffee that is actually good, because it is not the best for espresso by far, do not try cappuccino or even macchiato. Also the Super Crema name might be misleading, the amount of crema is just about the same than other brands. This is not a problem since you do not really need an ultra thick layer of crema, it makes a fair amount of crema just like any other fine beans."
2325,Neutral,"Had hopes, but...","I've sampled three coffees that had received a lot of 4/5-star reviews, and after tasting all three, I would rank this coffee third in the group.  I agree with another reviewer that coffee preferences are a very personal and subjective matter, but here are my brief comments about the three I tasted.<br /><br />I found the Lavazza Super Crema smooth, but ""flat"" as far as aroma and taste.  I had bought this one based on the review of several persons, one of whom had drunk it while growing up in his native Italy.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Maybe one of their other varieties is better?  I'm reluctant to take a second gamble.<br /><br />I bought a bag of Blue Mountain Blend after my fiance said she liked it, even after she had tried the pure Blue Mountain Jamaican whole bean coffee several times.  I noticed that the bag looked way too big for the 2lbs. of coffee beans in it.  To me, that indicates room for air space that would cause freshness to be compromised.  Nevertheless, the coffeeForever48 behaved like a total jerk.<br /> And I mean that in the nicest way possible. I made had a nice smooth, strong taste, but I still would rank it second.<br /><br />My number 1 ranking goes to Marley coffee's Jammin' Java Lion's Blend.  It had a rich flavor with just a hint of ""roastiness"" that added a pleasing note to its taste.  This one I will buy again.  Bear in mind that Jammin' Java is not necessarily Jamaican coffee beans, but as I indicated above, personal taste is what counts.  The Marley beans are slightly smaller, darker, and more oily than the other two.<br /><br />I am open to any other reviewer suggestions...<br /><br />10/01/11 Update - Brewed both the Blue Mountain Blend and the Lavazza Super Crema in a French Press after grinding in a fairly high-rated conical grinder.  Blue Mountain Blend wins competition hands down, IMO.  The Lavazza is strong, but does not have the pleasing notes in the aftertaste that the BMB has.  Will add to this review after I try French Pressing the Jammin' Java."
2326,Neutral,NOT fresh or oily,"I ordered this for name and price reasons. Yes, its is OK, but clearly NOT fresh.  The beans are not oily in the least, as espresso should be. I will NOT be ordering this again.<br /><br />Avoid."
2327,Neutral,Takes too long to Arrive,"The item is as described by the opinions of the other reviewers. A more major issue is that Amazon ships it via the US Postal Service which can take (an already shelved product) 3 -7 days to arrive. Hey, this is coffee, and it only has a limited life to live. Taking into account that it's a large bag for home use we still must keep it allive for a few more weeks till were done with it. It's been 5 days since they shipped it, but I still don't have it and now I wonder how old it will become when it finally arrives. Amazon needs to use an alternate shipping methode"
2328,Neutral,Excellent Beans - Old Bags!,"Ordered through Amazon subscription plan. First bag was not expired, but old enough that the seal leaked. Replacement bag was sealed, but still roasted almost a year ago. The Lavazza Super Crema makes excellent esspresso, but I am now buying it from Whole Latte Love. Just got my first shipment 8/10/2012 and the beans were roasted and packaged 6/18/2012. Much better!"
2329,Neutral,"Very good, but not super robust","I do not have a huge amount of espresso bean experience.  I've been grinding my own beans for drip coffee for many years, but just started my home espresso operation.  Compared to some other beans I've tried, the Lavazza beans were distinctly less oily.  There's a bit of ""chaff"" or ""husk"" during the grinding process.  This may be perfectly normal, but I was more accustomed to oily beans that maintained a bit of heaviness.<br /><br />The flavor is good and balanced, although not at all aggressive or robust.  (This could have something to do with my process, I really can't speak to that.)<br />Pulling a double to make caps or macchiatos, the flavor is very satisfying.  However, the additional milk in a latte bumps the need to at least a triple shot.<br /><br />No burnt flavor at all.  Crema is easy and consistent."
2330,Neutral,Disappointed,"After using Gevalia espresso beans for years, I decided to try something different.  I read all the great reviews for these beans and was excited to try them.<br />I wish I could say something positive.  Upon opening the bag, the beans were dry and not oily at all like I'm use to.  I ground some beans and made my first couple shots. Flavor was blah.  I thought maybe I didn't get a good grind or brew.  No such luck.  All other shots are the same.  Lacking flavor and actually not very much crema either considering this was the super crema.  Maybe I just got a bad bag, don't know.  I guess I will try another brand or try the other Lavazza beans."
2331,Neutral,Flavor Not So Good,"During the time period when ALL the Latte were off the shelf, purchase this item and found that I did not like the taste!! Try putting cream into this coffee, but you would literally need a large volume to taste better.  I guess I am not a connisour of coffees and this product is still on my shelf waiting for me to give it a way.  I like my Latte, so no more trying other brands."
2332,Neutral,moth balls,"Hazelnut coffee, I will have to admit , is new to me.  This coffee has the taste of moth balls.  I could not recommend it unless you love that smell."
2333,Neutral,Not enough punch!,"This coffee comes in a shallow disc, similar to the Starbucks espresso discs. It smells good while it is dripping but if you watch the coffee as it comes out, about 1/3 of it looks pretty much like water. And what you get is a cup of coffee that still smells good but is very weak on flavor. I don't want to waste it but I need to read the manual again and see if I can stop the process before all that's coming through is water. Then I'd use 2 discs and hopefully get a real cup of hazelnut flavored coffee."
2334,Neutral,Darker than expected,"I loved the flavor and strength of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  Since the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend was not available on Amazon, I shopped for the next best thing.  I thought it would be a great idea to purchase the 1/2 caff, and perhaps I would get the same great flavor, same milder coffee and quality as the regular Green Mountain I was used to (with half the caffine).  WRONG.  Although still a perfectly drinkable coffee, the 1/2 caff seems to be a darker roast and not nearly as mild as the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend. Actually tasted bitter, as compared to it's fully caffinated counterpart. Priced well and free shipping as an Amazon Prime member, so that's a plus. I won't throw it out, but did go right out shopping for the Breakfast Blend I was used to.  This box of Half-Caff will be for ""emergency"" use for me."
2335,Neutral,TP in Olympia,"This coffee is ok, but I wish they could make a decaf and half caf that had the flavor of regular coffee. It sort of has a slight maple taste to it."
2336,Neutral,Half Caff,"Coffee is ok but don't know whether I will reorder or not.  Rather weak but if your machine has the water level setting, I would suggest that you use one of the smaller cups."
2337,Neutral,Not the same Bold Flavor,"I wish I hadn't ordered so many, they aren't the same bold flavor as the Nantucket Blend. It's like making a cup of coffee and you didn't put enough grounds in, kind of watered down. I will try adding a little instant with every cup."
2338,Neutral,Weak,"Like all the coffee I've tasted for the Keurig this is pretty weak.  Actually, this is some of the weakest.  I suppose one could be polite and call it ""subtle"" but I'm not that person.  It does provide just the right amount of caffeine I need for a late afternoon boost and still let me sleep at night so it does serve its purpose.<br />Is there any strong and complex coffee for this machine?"
2339,Neutral,Hard Gum,"The box of cigars is certainly festive and appropriate for a work environment, especially if smoking is frowned on.  The bubblegum cigars are very hard though, more of a keepsake than to actually chew."
2340,Neutral,Energy Bar Has Never Tasted This Great!,"Snickers Marathon Long-Lasting Energy bar promises to give gym enthusiasts long lasting energy which is rarely found in most chocolate bars. It is typical to find lots of carbohydrates and fats in these chocolate bars, especially for Mars chocolate products, but long lasting energy? Isn't this just a fad?<br /><br />I have enjoyed Snicker products ever since I was a child. Guess Filipinos are patrons of most US products, especially their chocolates. I have accustomed my taste bud with the rich chocolate contents and satisfying chewiness these Snicker bars provide. I eat during examinations because a friend of mine informed me that chocolates are good brain boosters.<br /><br />However, the new challenge Snickers placed on their shoulder is to provide us with long lasting energy bars. I must admit that it gave me additional energy boost during stressful office hours but to say that it is long lasting is not acceptable.<br /><br />Gene Eden VIR 101 offers long lasting energy booster even if this is not the primary task of these all natural supplement. It is designed to shield the body from viral infection thus helping the body gain more energy for his or her daily activities.<br /><br />Mars may have exaggerated a bit in stating that its Snicker Long Lasting Energy Bar provides LONG lasting energy to its patrons. It would be enough to say that it gives extra-energy to those who will enjoy munching these tasty chocolates in between their gym work-outs."
2341,Neutral,Just a hint of coconut,"Depending upon how much you like M&Ms, will determine how much you like this product.  If you are crazy about M&Ms and the candy shelled coating, but don't want an overwhelming coconut flavoring, this product will probably meet your expectations.  It is just enough that you can taste it.  I was expecting a bit more coconut.  Certainly not to the point of a Mounds or Almond Joy, but something a bit stronger.  My coworkers who are not that sensitive to coconut flavoring, couldn't taste it at all.  They were ""blinded"" in that I did not tell them they were coconut M&Ms before I gave it to them. When I asked them if they could tell what flavor it was, most could not."
2342,Neutral,"Hot, but the flavor is lacking.","This sauce tastes like brown bread mixed with barbecue sauce and vinegar. Sorry if that doesn't sound appetizing, but thats what it is. It's hot (oh man, is it hot) but I just cant find a good food to pair it with.<br /><br />The sauce is so thick that it's nearly impossible to get it out of the bottle, and by the time you get it out, it comes out so fast that you're praying for the future of your [...].<br /><br />I have it, and I like it because its hot, but I don't use it. It's been used maybe once or twice in the past few months. I have hotter sauces that I use more frequently because they taste better.<br /><br />Buy it though, its the original!"
2343,Neutral,call 911!,"OK, I love hot sauce and spicy food. My chili can strip paint and clean engine parts. But this stuff is ridiculous.<br /><br />First time I saw it, I sniffed the bottle, thought ""not bad"", then put a drop the size of a BB on my finger and tasted it. I literally couldn't get my breath, and my tongue was sort of numb for a while. About 1/2 teaspoon to a pot of chili is about right, but do NOT under any circumstances put this stuff directly on food like you would with most hot sauce."
2344,Neutral,You guys lied to me,"Really Amazon, are all your stomachs this weak?? I wanted go get a good hot sauce and after reading the reviews here how this stuff will practically set your mouth on fire I eagerly ordered it. Maybe it's just me but when I tried just a drop of this sauce as reccomended, yes it was hot, and somewhat painful all around my tongue, lips and throat, but certainly tolerable. Ii feel I can casually put this stuff in my food.  then took about a teaspoon and put it on my tongue, i could feel my whole face sweating and my tongue burning. Drinking water didn't help. But the burning feeling goes away in less than a minute and you can start eating the sauce again. The taste itself is not very good but luckily i intend to use it really as an ingredient. If you think this is the hottest thing in the universe I feel sorry for you in a way because I'm sure there are hotter things out there."
2345,Neutral,What's all the hype about,I tried this sauce for the first time in SC a few months ago because my cousin Steven was talking about it. I rolled a couple of toothpicks in it and put it straight on my tongue to try it out and I was dipping my tacos and chips in it. I have had spicier.  I am from SoCal and that is normal for a lot of the mexican places I eat at. The only thing the sauce did was make my face sweat a little... As far as the burn in my mouth it was no hotter than the fried peppers you can pick up at any authentic mexican restaurant out here. I probably had the equivalent of a teaspoon in less than a half hour. I did not have to drink anything after it. The taste was okay. The only reason why I put it on my food was because it was the only spicy sauce in the house. It is a potent sauce... a little goes a long way but I was sorely disappointed by heat of it... maybe because it was because of all the hype.
2346,Neutral,"Hot, but not hot.","First of all, this hot sauce doesn't have any flavor. I thought it would be a bit sour, but no. Its tastes like eating a flaming fart which brings me to the point about smell...<br /><br />IT KILLS YOUR NOSE.<br /><br />Thats all I have to say, but one more thing... It burned through the cap and overflowed into the fridge. k bai"
2347,Neutral,"good, but not great","When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining."
2348,Neutral,just ok,having the variety was nice and the kids loved the colors but it wasnt great. the texture was chewy and there is a lot of kernels getting stuck in your teeth compared to others. It was ok tasting tho and always fun to try something new in the hot air popper.
2349,Neutral,it's ok,"Well, bought this for my dad for his birthday since he loves popcorn. These though, no where near as good as I had hoped. Lots of hulls and old maids. Adding butter makes them even less crisp even though they aren't very crisp once popped. Sticks in my teeth too. Sorry, not buying again."
2350,Neutral,"Taste is someone overpowering, has a noticeable after taste.","I will definitely have to work on tweaking the amount used.<br />The directions IMO had you using too much, it also left an aftertaste.<br />In my house we are not regular soda drinkers and have been using more sparking water.<br />My kids did not like this flavor, I may try mixing it with something else to try and balance the too strong taste."
2351,Neutral,She must be a picky eater.,"My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats..."
2352,Neutral,Sample?,I wish every brand would offer a 1 can sample for sale or even free so I can find out if my cat will eat it before<br />buying 12 cans.
2353,Neutral,Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.,"We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience."
2354,Neutral,My cats don't like it,"If my cats could leave reviews they would probably give this product a 1 star. Fortunately they can't, so I'm giving it a 3 stars for effort :)  I realize that different cats used to different foods, however mine for some reason would rather starve than eat turkey formula cat food from Wellness. Otherwise I trust Wellness brand, they seem to put good ingredients, and no grains.<br />Also there was no mentioning anywhere about quantity. It comes in 12 large cans.<br />Before getting it tho, I suggest you go to local Petco and get a smaller can of same Turkey formula and check if your cats will eat it."
2355,Neutral,Cats don't like,Our three cats don't like this variety. Probably because of the herring.<br />You would figure thyey would love the fish but I guess has too much of a fish odor.
2356,Neutral,Dented Cans AGAIN!,"I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account."
2357,Neutral,She eats it but it's like pulling teeth,"I was disappointed to have spent the money and then find that my cat does not really like this food.  She will eat it if she's starving and even then I have to sit near and coax her.  She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef.  I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer.  It's too thick and sticky.  Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast."
2358,Neutral,Wellness Review Turkey/Salmon,"We've been purchasing direct from retail stores, either PetSmart or Felix & Oscar's in Springfield, VA.  The condition of the cans shipped was not as good as I would have hoped.  Several cans were dented in each shipment.  Quality of the cat food is very good; cost savings may outweigh the shipping issues and the convenience of not going to the pet store."
2359,Neutral,Packaging problem,"My rating is based on the condition of the product when I recieved it.  Of the case of 12 cans I had ordered, 4 of them had serious dents.  I sent an email about the packaging but received no response.  I would give the product itself at least a 4 rating."
2360,Neutral,"Great, but mind the smell","My cat loves this food, but this particular flavor, beef and salmon, is a bit strong when it comes to the smell. I had to wash my hands more than once to get the smell entirely off. Now the problem is that my cat reeks of fish, she smells like a walking tuna sandwich. If you're okay with that, by all means get it, but I'm going to avoid this one in the future because I can't stand her smelling like this all the time."
2361,Neutral,Not to my cat's taste- but adding warm water helped,"I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again."
2362,Neutral,Loved the first three cans...,"After feeding my recently-acquired cat a case of Wellness Turkey and Salmon without issue, I fully expected her to love the Beef and Salmon as much.  Unfortunately, she loved only the first three cans and won't touch it now without adding some dry food to it.  Hopefully, she will still eat the Turkey and Salmon without any problems."
2363,Neutral,None of our cats would touch it,"We have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap Purina makes to Wellness, and for most of the flavors, they love it. They like it much better than Friskies. Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders."
2364,Neutral,Tasty but pricey,"A little expensive as a steady staple compared to brown rice or barley. If you're looking for fiber it has twice that per serving of brown rice, but 40% of barley. Interesting texture. Regular rice eaters could find it a taste treat."
2365,Neutral,Pods Ok but,"Melitta has a good taste and if you have no choice but to buy for your Senseo coffee maker, they are ok but you must know in advance they don't fit the senseo very well (too thick) and you have to force closing the top which I felt was the reason i had to replace my coffee maker."
2366,Neutral,melitta pods for Senseo coffee makers,"There is a problem with the Melitta pods for Senseo coffee makers. The pods are too thick and cause the locking mechanism to pop open during the brewing process, spilling<br />hot water outside of the nozzle. I have tried this multiple times, with the same result. If you use a used pod, the  already compressed pod works alright, but, of course, is not<br />producing full flavored coffee."
2367,Neutral,Easy but not for the strong coffee lover,Don't get me wrong. This is a fine product. It came well within it's date code and is a pretty good cup of coffee but I'm just more of a dark roast guy. I'll try another of Melitta's flavors.
2368,Neutral,Melitta Coffee Pods,"tastes ok but pods does not fit Senseo coffee maker, I wasted several pods to find a way to use them anyway."
2369,Neutral,"Good flavor, does not fit senseo well","I like this coffee, but as others have mentioned the pod is a bit thicker than the senseo.<br /><br />I tried both options:<br /><br />Put it in the single pod basket on the senseo, force the lock closed. This works well but feels like you will break the machine with time. It really needs forcing.<br /><br />Or you can put it in the double pod holder. The problem here is it is too loose and does not seal well leaving you with weak coffee. You can moisten the pod before putting it in the machine. This does result in good coffee but is an extra step.<br /><br />Also they come individually wrapped. Perfect for a hotel or other public use, but a bit of extra waste at home.<br /><br />I won't buy again, and am looking for another pod that works with Senseo."
2370,Neutral,This product is dog food not a snack for humans,I was looking for heathy sweet potato chips and see this item.  Ordered it quickly and had to return it because it<br />is for dogs not for humans.<br /><br />I have nothing against dogs or dog food.  But I think the Amazon website needs to make a clearer distinction<br />between dog snacks and human snacks and not list them all on the same page for people to choose.
2371,Neutral,A bit too oily,"It's a convenient way to get vegetables and it's healthy and vegan. I didn't like the amount of oil in it - too oily. I got tired of a tomato base soup too - but I eventually got through 2 cases. Some cans were dented, but we didn't get sick from them - but dents in food cans causes worry and concern.<br />I particularly liked the mushrooms in this. It was a little delight each time I got a mushroom in my mouth - just the right texture.<br />I hope Amy's is working on the BPA issue found in the lining of their (and most everybody else's) cans."
2372,Neutral,so-so,"for my taste this coffee is quite bitter, although it has no bitter aftertaste..the taste itself is quite ordinary...Lavazza is much better for me.."
2373,Neutral,Good Cookies But I Still Prefer Mallomars and Pinwheels,"I bought a box ( of 12 boxes, I guess that is only shipment that Amazon can send of these cookies ) of these cookies 2 weeks from Amaaon and guess what, NOW THEY""RE ALL GONE!  I think I ate 3 boxes of thse cookies and gave the rest away and sold a few.  My impression overall of these cookies is that they are very, very well made, the chocolate alone is decandent, the shell is crisp but can be crispier, but they DEFINITELY add TOO MUCH SUGAR IN THESE COOKIES and for that rason I prefer Mallomars to these cookies, which are the closest cookies in comparison to these.  Mallomars look like Whippets and but they have a crispier shell, the chocolate is not as good cos it's not so rich and dark, but the cookie base is more solid and the marshmallow is not so sugary.  When you eat a Whippet the overall first taste you experience on your palette is a rush of sugar, but with Mallomars you taste the marshmallowy goodness with the sugar.<br />  Pinwheels, a marshmallow cookie that is larger, richer, darker and better overall than both Whippets and Mallomars, have a chocolate coating that is not as good as Whippets but the cookie baase is chocolate, it is more solid and the marshmallow is understated.  I don't know if in Montreal, Quebec or wherever in Quebec they love these cookies ( on the package it says they are "" Quebec's favorite cookie! ) they LOVE SUGAR but overally my impression is good of these, they defintely did grow on me after I eat maybe two boxes, but I will never buy them again, not one package and definitely not 12, they are just way to sugary for me since my local grocery stores carries PInwheels year round and Mallomars when they're in season there is no need to buy them again.  I heartily reccomend that you spend your hard-earned money on Pinwheels rather than these, if you're a sugar-concious American who apprciates a good cookie."
2374,Neutral,Whippet Cookies by Dare,"This is the second time I've ordered these cookies. The flavor is very good, and I cannot purchase these locally.<br />I was a little disappointed because, both times it seems as though the box was stored or shipped in too much heat. All the cookies are stuck together, and the chocolate seemed a little old because it was whitish and grainy.<br />I still enjoy them, but I just wish they looked like they do in the picture on the box."
2375,Neutral,Product good: Delivery poor,"The product was shipped by U.P.S.  It was clearly marked ""Chocolate - Store in a cool dry place.""  It was, nonetheless, left at my doorstep when I was not home.  I do not know how long it had been sitting in the Florida heat before I got home, but the product was melted and all but inedible.<br /><br />It strikes me that I shuld have received a notice of attempt to deliver, and the product should be kept in a ""cool dry place"" until it could be accepted by me."
2376,Neutral,Good Price,The price paid was fair for the quality. I would prefer a finer grind to get more flavor from the grounds. It is a mild roast but has a good flavor. For being organic the price can't be beat.
2377,Neutral,Great Product but My Dogs Won't Eat It,Great product by Iams but my two mini pinschers would not eat it until they were starving.  I had them on the yellow package puppy Iams and they seemed to like that more.  Don't get me wrong the product is solid with healthy ingredients but my dogs just wouldn't take it.
2378,Neutral,NO LICORICE,"The descripton promises all sorts of flavors.  True, what is there is pretty good.  But I bought this for my daughter's family in May.  Her husband loves licorice.  A sample package they bought in Las Vegas had the licorice flavor included, but in 5 lbs of taffy - there was not a single piece of licorice in this order!  She was very disappointed, and therefore, so was I.  I can understand now why a 2-lb bag of licorice is suggested as a purchase to accompany this.  But 7 lbs???  That's what it would be to buy both.  Well, eventually I did buy the 2 lb bag of licorice, but not from this seller.  Also, this product does not have the Taffy Town tags that the sample from Las Vegas, and also the 2-lb bag I purchased, have on the candy wrappers.  I don't know what that is all about."
2379,Neutral,OK,"The flavor of the taffy was good (not at all ""watery"" as stated in other reviews). However, the taffy was quite stiff, and did not seem very fresh.<br />Additionally, this taffy is made with evaporated milk, which was a problem for several people in our family who have milk allergies. I was totally unaware that salt water taffy could/would contain milk."
2380,Neutral,very mild,"this tea is VERY mild. it came on time and was well packaged, not quite the flavor i wanted but it is a good drink"
2381,Neutral,yummy but sometimes scary,"I love the product, they're yummy....however, my baby has choked as well as another friends baby while using these...they tend to break off and don't dissolve too fast. I'm sure when my baby is older they may be ok, but def a choking hazard!!"
2382,Neutral,Not for beginning chewers,"After reading the reviews on these teething biscuits, I was so excited I ordered a case of them. They're still sitting in my cupboard three months later. After a couple tries and near choking incidents, I have decided to wait on giving any more to my son. He is a beginning chewer and could not handle the large pieces. I would recommend using these for older kids ONLY. Had the same negative results with Earth's Best Teething biscuits. The only teething biscuits I recommend for actual teething babies are the Mum Mums. Those melt in the mouth, so no possibility of choking and keep my car relatively crumb free. Win, win."
2383,Neutral,Mixed results,"I have been purchasing these for several years. The kids liked them, and continued to like them after they got their teeth, then the adults started eating them, and we've just kept buying them.  But our last order contained 12 boxes of burned, over baked biscuits that no one could eat.  We plan to keep buying, and hopefully that won't happen again."
2384,Neutral,Good Tea - not sure about weightloss claim,"Good Herbal tea - no ceffeine, refreshing taste. However, I cannot vouch for the wieghtloss claim. Maybe because I don't use it to lose weight or maybe because drinking the same quantity of any fluid (water?) before a meal will make you feel ""full"" anyway ....."
2385,Neutral,just okay,not okay for a drip coffee.  this fine grind does not work well in my drip machine and 3 out of 4 bricks arrived compressed and one not.<br />will not buy again but will work for a one time deal.
2386,Neutral,not bad not good,"Strong, little bitter, but don't have a rich coffee flavor. You can find the same flavor on supermarket less value, Pilon, Bustelo, etc."
2387,Neutral,Not so Gusto,I know what other reviewers mean when they say it tasted like Folgers.  It was OK but definitely not e Gusto. It was a good deal for the price. I forgot what I paid but I know it was on sale.
2388,Neutral,Taste of recycled coffee,After reading all the hype I was lured in to buying this so-called coffee.  Tastes like coffee grind recycled after first use.  The coffee we buy from local super market costs the same but tastes much better.
2389,Neutral,"Not the greatest, but not the worst either.","I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend."
2390,Neutral,good but rosso is better,"Lavazza  is best coffee for espresso. Although this blend is good, the Rossa version is better coffee.  The cost is a bit higher, but since you are saving money making your own espresso, spend the extra pennies."
2391,Neutral,back to Caffe Espresso,"I was buying Lavazza Caffe Espresso at local vons for 5.99. Now it's 7.99 so I checked amazon. still more than 5.99 so I bought this, cheapest Lavazza for 18.98 with subscription.<br /><br />according to their website, Caffe Espresso is medium, this is dark roast and this has some sweetness.<br /><br />when i opened the package, soon i noticed this has a stronger aroma, a bitter kind. unlike starbucks italian dark roast, it's still brown.<br /><br />i used bialetti moka machine. usually make it latte. i think this is bitterer than Caffe Espresso and I feel some bitterness remains on my tongue. maybe this is more like natural Espresso taste but I prefer Caffe Espresso. and i have one opened pack and three unopened packs left..."
2392,Neutral,not what I expected,"For the longest time I've been looking for something that compares to Illy espresso (medium roast) at a lower price. Thought this was a deal as I've been paying $14+ per can of Illy. I read all the hype & tried to order via Amazon only to be told they will NOT ship this product to Hawaii.I found the Crema e Gusto somewhere else for less than $9/pack; sadly, I was disappointed with the slightly bitter undertone and will most likely go back to Illy. Any Illy addicts out there who found something as good at a lower price?"
2393,Neutral,Not as robust as Cafe Bustelo,From the other reviews I thought this would be at least as full flavored as Cafe Bustelo but it's not. It's more mild and I prefer a deeper stronger coffee flavor. I do like the creamy texture of this coffee but not enough to switch to it. I may try other varieties by Lavazza since it gets such good reviews all the time.
2394,Neutral,Strong!,The fragrance of this tea is wonderful.  The taste is strong and spicy which I don't care for so at first I tried adding honey.  The honey made it taste disgusting.  So the next night I added 1% low fat milk which made the taste more tolerable.  It also seems to make me drowsy so I drink it near bed time.
2395,Neutral,dragon eye,"mom and i both liked this tea at changs.  it seems a bit watered down at home and i have even doubled up.  the flavor is nice, sweet and flowery but it is weak.  all in all we still like it."
2396,Neutral,Made in China,"I ordered these late on a Thursday and they arrived on Monday afternoon.  I thought that was great processing/shipping considering they came from California, and I live in South Carolina.  All lollipops were packaged well and none were broken.  Taste was average.  Not really cherry (like in description), just sweet.  One disappointing note... the wrapper on the lollipop clearly says ""Oriental Trading Company"" and ""Made in China.""  It wasn't really fitting with the image of freshness I had from looking at their store description."
2397,Neutral,Not The Same as the Nestle product,"The Wonka product I received is not the same texture, taste, pleasure of the Nestle version this. I wont buy this any more.  Breaks down too fast in your mouth.  Too sweet as well."
2398,Neutral,Pita,Would not order this again.  Buying at a local store would have been better.  Seemed dry and not as fresh as I hoped.
2399,Neutral,Not bad for preservative pita,"This stuff can travel to your house by USPS or UPS truck because it uses chemical preservatives.<br /><br />Otherwise, nice taste, especially good when toasted or at least microwave re-heated. Best use: Sandwich wraps."
2400,Neutral,Be Prepared,"Just note when ordering you will receive 48 bottles. Not in the display box, but 48 separate bottles with some bubble wrap on top."
2401,Neutral,A critical review,"I love this gum. 5 star love it. I am doing this to replace the only current negative review, which is just ridiculous."
2402,Neutral,"Taste like soy sauce, but with less salt.","It took some getting used to, but I am satisfied with the taste. I recommend to anyone on a salt restricted diet."
2403,Neutral,"crunchy, but lacking flavor","it was cheap, it was delivered fast & in good condition, but the ""hot"" variety is seriously lacking in flavor compared to the regular variety.<br />though tasty & satisfying, next time i'll stick with the original!"
2404,Neutral,Less spicier than the real Korean version,"I guess NongShim made this as export version as they do with many many other noodle products.<br />Usually they are much less spicy.<br />And this is the same.<br />When I opened this bag, it was yellow, not red at all.<br />Original Korean version of this snack is much more red in color and has very nice spicy taste.<br />But this barely has any spicy to it if not at all.<br />Well, I couldn't taste any spicy at all, seriously AT ALL.<br />If you have Korean supermarket nearby, go buy one from there and compare yourself.<br />My non-Korean husband agrees with me one this so..."
2405,Neutral,"Not too shrimpy, not too hot.",Odd texture too.  I prefer the shrimp chips that are more like pork rinds.  These are more like cripy french fries.
2406,Neutral,Nice alternative to other snacks,"Although they don't really have much of a seafood flavor, let alone shrimp, they are a bit spicy and nice to snack on asw an alternative to other std. similar snacks."
2407,Neutral,"Easier online, no deal on price","I purchased this product online because I couldn't find it in the stores at that time (2 days later it was in the store also). It's good that comes quick, save a trip to the store, however, no deal on the price; same as Walmart, Kroger, etc."
2408,Neutral,50c per box more expensive than stores,"I purchased this product online because I couldn't find it in the stores at that time (2 days later it was in the store also). It's good that comes quick, save a trip to the store, however, the price is so much higher than Walmart, Kroger, etc (50c per box more expensive, total 7$ more expensive than the stores)"
2409,Neutral,Geber Barley Cereal,the only reason I purchased this on amazon is because I could not find it in the stores and the pediatrician had recommended it for my infant grandson.  It does not disolve well and tends to clump up in the nipple.
2410,Neutral,Its Coffee.,"Its a good robust coffee, however not much different from any other brand as coffees go. Not sure it is worth the energy of ordering, shipping cost (if you have to pay it). I am at the store at least 4 times a week so picking up coffee I like is not a problem."
2411,Neutral,packaging overload,"My baby loves these.  However, the packaging is over the top.  Do the rusks really need to be individually wrapped, as well as, wrapped in another plastic bag, inside of a cardboard box?"
2412,Neutral,Baby loves it!,"We've only tried the vegetable version but my 6 month old loves it. It dissolves right when you bite it, and she enjoys holding it and putting it in her mouth. I only gave it 3 stars because it is no different from the rice crackers they sell at the Asian groceries. I thought I was getting a good deal on Amazon, but the ones at the Asian groceries are only 2-3 bucks a package. I agree with a previous poster that this company uses an awful lot of packaging. It's a nuisance especially since there is so much eco-awareness nowadays.<br /><br />BTW, my two year old loves these too so I always have them handy in the trunk of the car. These will get crushed in your diaper bag, so stash somewhere safe :)"
2413,Neutral,"MIC is fine, but THE NUTRITION FACTS are not","Some people are concerned about this product being made in China, personally I think it's fine, since it's from the largest rice cracker manufacturer in the world, they should have decent quality control systems-- after all, the ingredients from the frightening food scandals in China never appears in any of their product that's made in China. (Interestingly, some of their adult rice snacks made in Taiwan were involved).<br /><br />However, I hope I've read the nutrition facts before purchasing this product:it has sugar and sodium. Baby food are not supposed to have sugar and salt added into it. THEY ARE FOR ADULTS! Especially, the sodium per serving for this product is about 2/3 the value for reduce fat potato chips. Since you cannot return grocery purchases on Amazon, think twice before you buy this. My daughter is 8 months old, I'll probably give her this after she's 12 months old -- since I cannot return this anyway, but I won't give her too much in a day simply because of they added salt into this product."
2414,Neutral,Manufactured in China,"My 12 month old has just been diagnosed with a wheat/egg/nut allergy, so I have been hunting for snacks that she can tolerate. I was pretty excited to find these and I purchased the 6 pack. She does like them a lot, but I have to say that I was surprised to see that the rice husks are made in China. Had I known that fact, I would have never bought them. I wish Amazon would have listed that under product description."
2415,Neutral,Sticky stick of a mess,"Baby Mum Mum makes a sticky mess.  I suppose no more or less then other teething crackers.  I do like that the grams of sugar is minimal compared to other teething biscuits.  I started giving our 8 month old wheat, unsalted pretzels which is the perfect shape and size for his little fingers.  The pretzels also create less of a mess.  I give the Baby Mum Mums right before planned bath time."
2416,Neutral,Generic chicken breasts,"Nothing makes these chicken breasts special whatsoever. They are standard generic tasting chicken breasts, tiny ones at that. They are tender and juicy when grilled, I will say that...but you'll be through eating one in less than 2 minutes. There's no difference between Omahas chicken breasts and regular chicken breasts I can buy in any grocery store Save a lot/Aldi included....for well over 1/2 the price of what they charge for these and for nearly quadruple the amount. So, why charge so much for these? I can get behind their steaks, even though they're overpriced too, and a few other Omaha products like the hot dogs and stuffed baked potatoes, but can't really get behind these chicken breasts. It's not like these are organic chicken breasts that have a decent size to them, which is what the price Omaha charges for them would suggest. These are as generic as generic gets. Would of been fine if 1 of their chicken breasts was the size of 2 of their chicken breasts. Instead it's like they got 1 large chicken breast and cut it it up to make 4 out of it. Luckily, I received these in a comped sampler. There's no reason whatsoever for anyone to buy just these chicken breasts through Omaha Steaks as Omaha gives you no reason to. Omaha really needs to make their portions bigger. People would be fine paying their prices if the portions were bigger...but half the things they sell the price to size ratio leaves you feeling ripped off. Not that I paid for these as like I said they were comped, but if I did no doubt I'd feel pretty ripped off. Change your mentality Omaha. Instead of less is more, think MORE is MORE. Get with the times."
2417,Neutral,Not for my dog...,"I had high hopes when I started my 1 y/o golden on this food.  I believe in the quality of the ingredients and the brand itself is easily available at our local petsmart store.  Unfortunately, even after switching brands gradually, our dog continues to have abnormally soft stools.  He did seem to love the taste...  but I am currently feeding him homemade ground turkey/ rice combo. and will gradually get him started on a different blue buffalo type (the large breed version).  We'll see how that one works out... it doesn't have quite as much protein and we're hopeful that his system will handle it better.  Update:  Out dog did great after we switched him to the large breed Blue formula.  He is currently on the weight control version and loving it... no more problems.  Very pleased with the brand overall!"
2418,Neutral,viscioup viper hot sauce,Not 2 bad definatly not the hottest but I liked it not a bad taste just not hot enuff 4 me blaires ultra death sauce is hotter
2419,Neutral,Not what i was expecting !,"I guess it's just that i'm a midwesterner, but this was *not* what i was expecting.  Not necessarily in a bad way, but there is not a hint of onion/garlic in this product.  New York Style... is what it must be."
2420,Neutral,Made in Bulgaria!,Not made in New York!! Why Not?<br /><br />The package is not reclosable.<br /><br />Great taste.
2421,Neutral,"Yummy garlic bagel chips, but....",Roses are red<br /><br />Rain gives them a soakin'<br /><br />I wish the bagel chips<br /><br />came to me less broken.
2422,Neutral,Bold K-cups coffee,"I like bold coffee. This is a little bolder than I like. But for those who like it strong, they will enjoy this."
2423,Neutral,Not one of my Favorites,"I don't know, people seem to like this k-cup, but it just did not do it for me.  Maybe I got a bad batch, as it was simply overpowering for me.  And I do like many of the bolder k-cups, such as Midnight Magic and Rainforest Espresso, but those are simply better coffees to me.  Maybe I'll give the Emeril's regular another chance, but it did not win me over the first time around.  As a side-note, I really like the Emeril's decaf--it is much more drinkable to me than the Emeril's regular."
2424,Neutral,A little unbalanced,"I love good strong coffee. It's a combination on how it's roasted and the beans used. This coffee is just way too strong. It is unbalanced and though isn't bitter (which comes from weaker coffee) it is a tad over roasted and charred tasting. Instead of tasting toasty nuances you are stuck with a smack in the face. Though very good for that wake up coffee, it's not the coffee to have if you want to savor the rich and delicate nuances that many good coffees bring to the table."
2425,Neutral,Nice bold K-Cup but left a weird after taste,This is a good choice for a K-Cup if you like a bold rich cup of coffee. I ordered this brand for 3-4 months because it  was the best tasting bold K-Cup I found.<br /><br />I am giving it three stars because the last few shipments were not that great. It left both me and my husband with a weird metallic taste after one cup.<br /><br />I ordered Martinson's bold K-Cups about a month ago and loved it! I probably will not buy this brand again.
2426,Neutral,Pretty good if you don't get one with a defective seal,"This coffee actually tastes pretty good for a darker roast however the number of defective K-cups with seal problems can be significant.  The issue is that the seal covering the Kcup, which gets punctured to enable the drip through, seems to continually burst open during brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in your mug and quite a mess of the machine.  My wife and I have started calling these ""bursters"" as it happens quite frequently with these Emeril's Kcups.  You can clearly hear it from far away when you get a burster and I think if you were to be doing something directly over the machine (such as putting dishes away in a cabinet above it) there is a possibility of getting in contact with some of the scalding hot steam from the sudden release of the pressure when the seal breaks open.  The seal bursts right at the final peak brewing time, probably at about the last 30% of the brewing process.  The result are a lot of coffee grounds in your mug and over the machine brewing area.<br /><br />I have been buying a lot of Kcups quite frequently in bulk that past few months.  I've tried many different types of Kcups and have purchased several hundred of each, I have never had this happen to any except the Emeril ones.  This is not just an isolated incident, there a significant number of defective ones in each of the 18 count boxes.  Usually if you get a box which has a burster you are going to get quite a few in there, probably around 5 at least.<br /><br />Wherever these specific Kcups are being made, there is a clearly a problem in the manufacturing processing and quality controls checks.  I've also seen a few cases where I have gotten a Kcup that has 2 seals pressed onto it thus resulting in a broken seal right out of the box.<br /><br />The coffee actually tastes pretty good, I really like darker roasts and this is one of my favorite ones however the quality control needs to be significantly improved.  If I was paying full retail for these I would be pretty annoyed, I think I've paid full retail for these once at a premium supermarket and sure enough there were a couple bursters in that box so it is not an issue with the bulk purchases or anything like that.  As I said I've bought hundreds of other brands in bulk and have had no issues yet."
2427,Neutral,Over roasted...,"I am a fan of strong black coffee, but this product tastes almost over roasted to me. Of all the K cups I have tried, this would probably be my least favorite."
2428,Neutral,COUNT THE K-Cups,"The coffee itself is awesome.  Good, strong taste.  It is the only kind I order.  However, I counted the k-cups this time since the box you see is all they come in.  They are dumped in there.  I decided to count them this time and I only received 45 k-cups not 50.  I called Amazon and they refunded me 10% which is what the 5 cups were worth.  I feel they should have done a little more for the trouble, but I won't make a deal out of that.  Just make sure you count them when you open the box."
2429,Neutral,"This is good, but it's far from the best.","Don't mean to be the one who rains on the bandwagon (pardon the metaphor crash), but, while it is definitely true what other reviewers have written -- that the coffee is very strong, very thick, and very dark (add in an acid level commensurate with the sludge-factor) -- I don't find the taste all that strong, and taste is important.<br /><br />True, these K-Cups will provide a pleasant-tasting beverage the consistency and color of Louisiana mud, but for taste, one can do a lot better.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had K-cups of coffee back-to-back today, one of this type and one of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1CC02"">Keurig K-Cup ""Mini-Brewers"" Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold</a>, which is, unfortunately, sold out at the moment.  True, Newman's (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste.  It's a lot ""Bold""er than this brand.<br /><br />One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the ""Big Easy Bold"" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf.  Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and selecting my own brand and grind.  My current favorite brand of coffee comes from a pair of small roasting houses in Washington state and Alaska.  I keep a couple days' worth ground and ready to put into the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>s, and there are few pre-packed ground K-Cups that can come anywhere close to the richness of the flavors and choices available if one ""rolls one's own.""<br /><br />I've got nothing against Emeril's, and it's a far superior cup of coffee to anything you'll get in most restaurants.  But, happily, we can best that effort without trying too hard."
2430,Neutral,I think I reviewed these in the past...,We bought a box.  They kept exploding in the Keurig Machine.  We received a second box and they worked better.  We just bought another box and now every 5th one or so explodes in the machine.  The malfunction ranges from dripping coffee and granules spilling over the sides of the cartridge holder to spraying hot water everywhere.<br /><br />The coffee tastes good though.
2431,Neutral,Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee,"If you like your coffee strong, you will like this.  There is a slightly bitter taste typical with most bold coffee (I guess).  I prefer a medium blend, however I can brew two cups from one kcup and get a cup to my liking.  So you might consider brewing two cups from one kcup and cut your cost in half."
2432,Neutral,Average cup 'o Joe.,"I like a good strong cup of joe.  This is just a strong cup of average joe.  It is no Community coffee, no 8 o'clock coffee with the spoon standing straight up.  It is better than many other standard k cups.  But still I think there are better full bodied k cups out there."
2433,Neutral,"Excellent bold coffee, high price","I can purchase an 18 pack of these at Target for $11.99 (that's $0.61/cup) instead of the much-too-high $0.85 per cup price here. Beware Amazon Prime members....K cups aren't a good deal on Amazon, despite the free two day shipping.<br />The coffee itself is GREAT. I basically like a cup of mud, as bold as it gets. This is that, with a great burnt taste and wonderful aroma.<br />HIGHLY recommend the coffee, but get it at Target."
2434,Neutral,Weak Taste and smell,"I didn't care for this blend because for a extra bold, it had a weak taste.  Its hard to explain but a bold and extra bold has a dark, rich taste to it, and this blend was disappointing.  I was just missing that bold flavor.  It tasted like McDonald's coffee that has been sitting for an hour.  The smell was also weak."
2435,Neutral,"It's OK, There are a lot of bold k-cup options. This one is just OK.",We have tried a lot of bold K cups and this one had a flat aftertaste. It did not have that flavor that sticks with you. We prefer Newmans Own Extra bold as our fav Bold offering. But we do have some family members who prefer this one so we get a box about once a year.<br /><br />Vanilla Bean Bam is the best Emeril that we have had. It is very good!
2436,Neutral,"Bold, but others are better","This is a bold cup of coffee, but if you prefer a bold cup with a little more of a fun taste, go over to Coffee People or Newmans Bold or we even really like Santa's Buzz....just better ones out there...."
2437,Neutral,Too Strong for Our Taste,"We just recently got our Keurig brewer and have been expeerimenting with different coffees.  My husband wanted to try something a little stronger, so I ordered the Emeril's Big Easy Bold.  It was a little too bold for his taste, but he said it was a good-tasting coffee.  For those who like a stronger tasting coffee, it is probably a good one."
2438,Neutral,WAY TOO Strong!!,If you like really strong coffee this is for you!!! Emeril definitely takes it up a notch!
2439,Neutral,Very Robust,"I make two (2) cups with one ""K-Cup"" it is indeed a robust coffee, not burnt tasting like dark roast, just strong."
2440,Neutral,Too strong for me!,"Interestingly, I do not disagree with the positive reviews -- this is a super strong coffee! Army coffee, as one reviewer said! Or, a slap in the face, as another one said! This is just too strong for me. I thought I liked strong coffee until I tasted this one. It made me realize I'm really a medium type of girl. I drink my coffee black and I had to water this one down to be able to drink it at all. I would have given only one star, b/c I don't like it personally, but gave it three b/c I recognize that what I hate about it is exactly what some will love about it! So, army coffee lovers, slap-in-the-face coffee lovers, this is for you! Medium guys and gals, not so much."
2441,Neutral,What happened to Emeril's?,"I have to agree with Dr. Pete's review below.  Up until this batch, Emeril's Big Easy was by far my favorite coffee.  To give you an idea of what my taste runs to, I also drink Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast along with an occasional Van Houtte's Honduran.  However, Emeril's was my standard cup.  But this latest bunch is nearly tasteless and watery!  It used to have a great aroma, full body, and was easily drinkable.  The only reason I didn't score it lower was because it is still not bitter or has a bad after taste.<br /><br />I am not sure what to do now.  I just put this on auto renew when I got this batch. I'm kinda' scared to keep on getting it, if it is going to stay this way. I might just cancel it and drink more Black Tiger (the most similar IMHO).  Too bad; I have frequently seen coffee quality from the same brand change in my life- and not only in the k-cups.<br /><br />Update: I tried using this on my 7.5oz instead of 9.5oz setting, and it is somewhat better.  However, it is still not nearly as flavorful as it usually was on 9.5oz.  I am really puzzled why more people have not experienced this; maybe my taste buds are growing Old? ;o)  However, my other coffees still taste the same."
2442,Neutral,a little sharp...,"This was my first time trying this brew of Kcup. It is ok, but the flavor is a bit acidic. I like a bold brew, even though I do add cream and Equal. When using this Kcup, I found I used at least one extra sweetener packet and twice the half & half. Friends of mine have enjoyed this flavor, however.<br /><br />I'd like to find a brand of kcup that is similar to Newman's Own, extra bold.  I have found this brand on Amazon, but it is through outside sellers, so not eligible for subscribe & save. The price through these vendors is also nearly twice the price of most of the kcups offered on amazon. So, for now, I will keep trying different varieties of kcups and trudge to Walmart to buy boxes of Newman's Own Bold 18 kcups for $10. If I see them on Amazon, I'll probably order several boxes."
2443,Neutral,Quite a jolt,"It made me realize I do have limits with caffeine. I drink my coffee black and I had to water this one down to be able to drink it at all. I would have given only one star, b/c I don't like it personally, but gave it three b/c I recognize that what I hate about it is exactly what some will love about it! So, all the coffee lovers, , this is for you! Medium guys and gals, not so much. Interestingly, I do not disagree with the positive reviews -- this is a really strong coffee! Emirils coffee, as one reviewer said! Or, a slap in the face, as another one said! This is just too strong for me. I thought I liked strong coffee until I tasted this one."
2444,Neutral,Love the coffee but not the new higher Amazon prices,"Love this coffee. However, now that Amazon has substantially raised, by 25-30% the prices across the board and subscribe and save has been removed I have found, at least temporarily, a cheaper place to buy. If you have a Bed Bath and Beyond near and get the 20% off coupons you can buy three 18 box cartons and save about $5. Cost me with tax about $25 and I got 6 extra cups vs the 48 box offered here. Just a suggestion. There may be other places as well.<br /><br />I do enjoy buying from Amazon and hope, maybe after the holidays? that the prices will become competitive again."
2445,Neutral,Underwhelming Brew,"I found this coffee to have a robust flavor, but lacking in the dark roasted richness I had expected.  In addition, the blend trickles through my brewer in fits and starts, unlike the thirty-second brew I can get from other K-cup varieties."
2446,Neutral,OK FLAVOR,"THIS COFFEE IS JUST OK FOR OUR TASTE.  FOR CRISTMAS I RECEIVED A COFFEE MAKER AND STARTED ORDERING KCUPS FROM AMAZON...LOOKING FOR ONE WE LIKED....THIS IS OK..IT IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE FOR JUST BEING OK.  EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT, YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ONE YOU LIKE."
2447,Neutral,aging coffee,"Should have figured...price was ""too good to be true"" and when I recieved product I saw why....expiration date 20 days away. Not thinking I can drink 96 cups in 20 days...oh well, live and learn."
2448,Neutral,They are just OK,"I bought a whole case of these to satisfy my chocolate cravings while I was pregnant, based on the 5 star reviews it had received.  I'm not sure why everyone is so enamored by this bar.  It doesn't have any 'real'chocolate in it at all - it has more of a marshmallow fluff consistently filling flavored with hazelnut.  Don't like."
2449,Neutral,Not so crazy for these,These are so-so..not the real biscotti but a little to crumbly for my taste..they taste like cookie crumbs mashed together.
2450,Neutral,Gluten Free Biscotti,"This is not as tasty as Pamela's Almond Biscotti, nor as good as other chocolate biscotti I have had.  Wish Pamela's would make a vanilla biscotti dipped in chocolate--that would be fantastic!"
2451,Neutral,"cook in brentwood,ca","Ok, guys, saw this as an ingredient in a ""Chopped"" episode and had to Google - we are diving in on this intersting local specialty on your recommendations.....made my husband hanker for canned bacon, something we took camping as kids that was salty and disgusting. Thank god it was $140 for 12 on Amazon......brown bread not cheap at $45 for 12 with shipping. Hope we don't have to give to food pantry......."
2452,Neutral,Beans r a bust,"These beans were just ""okay"" I probably will not buy this particular brand again. Disappointing In texture, flavor & chew ability"
2453,Neutral,Decent noodles if you can find them at a much better price. I can find gourmet noodles in this cost range.,"These noodles are a decent find, but don't overpay for them. Currently priced at 17 USD / 12pk, with the ramen at 15 USD / 12pk, I can get the same product in the same exact format in the price range of 2-4 USD, even at WalMart, where prices are not that competitive. The same goes for all the maruchan instant soups and noodles on this site currently. Wait until the price becomes reasonable, then stock up, otherwise buy elsewhere. Don't be insane and pay what I can get a decent dinner for, for a small package of instant noodles."
2454,Neutral,Not as good as I expected,"This product was very salty for me and my family. After eating, we had to drink a lot of water..  Did not taste any Pesto since salt overtook the whole Mezzaluna.<br /><br />If you buy this product, you may want to think how you can make this salty taste less stands out.<br />It takes 15 min. to cook.  I am going back to Barilla Tortellini."
2455,Neutral,A 'light' black tea,Upon ordering this tea I thought it would be a strong and dark earl grey. Instead I received a tea that is very bland and in order to improve on the flavor I have to double up on my bags.<br /><br />This tea is about half as strong as Bigelow's earl grey blend.
2456,Neutral,LOVE Twinings Earl Grey..... but,"We love getting this by the case since we drink so much of it.  However, the last case showed up and about 90% of all the bags were not ""stuffed"" and folded closed properly.  Resulting in massive amounts of tea spilling out.  Not the end of the world.  you could just stuff the bag into a tea ball and that would get you by.  We resorted to shaking all the tea to the side of the bag that was folded closed properly and rolling up the edge and winding the string around it to keep it that way while steeping.  Again, not the end of the world but an annoyance.  If the next case shows up like this I think we'll send it back.  But I don't know who to request to make good on it; Amazon or Twinings"
2457,Neutral,Earl Grey on a budget,"If you are on a tight budget, as I am, then I think this Earl Grey is fine. For the same price, I prefer Bigelow.  For Pete's sake, stay away from Lipton's black tea.  (I can't speak as to their green tea.) I used to drink Lipton tea as we get the bags free at work.  Once I tried Twinings and then Bigelow, there was no going back. The Lipton teas are bitter tasting in comparison.<br /><br />If you are able to splurge once in a while, try Mountain Rose Herbs brand of Earl Grey. The difference will blow you away.  The bergamot really stands out in this tea, I mean REALLY.  I haven't seen it offered online here at Amazon.  I had to order it directly from Mountain Rose and it was $11 for one pound plus shipping. The tea is organic, kosher and fair trade certified! Their website is here:[...]<br /><br />So, if you like Twinings, try Bigelow, which is the same price, but a tad better.  If you are able to splurge, try Mountain Rose...but be warned, it will spoil you for other teas forever."
2458,Neutral,"Good, but not impressed",the tea bag lost flavor after just one seep. I can usually get more flavor on 2nd 3rd seep with tazo's
2459,Neutral,Not what i was expecting !,"I guess it's just that i'm a midwesterner, but this was *not* what i was expecting.  Not necessarily in a bad way, but there is not a hint of onion/garlic in this product.  New York Style... is what it must be."
2460,Neutral,Made in Bulgaria!,Not made in New York!! Why Not?<br /><br />The package is not reclosable.<br /><br />Great taste.
2461,Neutral,"Yummy garlic bagel chips, but....",Roses are red<br /><br />Rain gives them a soakin'<br /><br />I wish the bagel chips<br /><br />came to me less broken.
2462,Neutral,NOT AS GOOD AS FULL SIZED,"I had tried and really liked the full sized version of this<br /><br />but the ""cup of soup"" size was just not as good"
2463,Neutral,Shaken and stirred,"The soups that I ordered were delicious. Let me begin with that. However, it took me awhile to receive them. The first order I received was only an empty box. Apparently it was damaged during shipping and was torn open. I emailed Amazon and they replaced the shipment immediately with no questions asked. THANK YOU.<br /><br />The second (same) shipment that I received was also damaged. This time, the outside of the packaging was fine, but the soups were leaking. Of the 32 total soup packets, 8 of them work broken open.<br /><br />The failing, I believe, is not in the shipping but rather the packaging of these. They need to be shipped in a tight box rather than the large box they were delivered.<br /><br />I operate a small shop inside an office building, and really would like to continue ordering these soups, however, they are too expensive to lose 25% upon delivery.<br /><br />Thanks, I look forward to improvements...at least in shipping.<br /><br />Regards,<br />John Jean<br />[...]."
2464,Neutral,No Sugar is a Lie!  Taste sooo good though.,"I was trying to buy a more healthier type of frappe, as I love cold coffee drinks.  I was stationed in Iraq, but hot coffee just didn't do it for me...especially in 121 degree weather.  Well, the front label says ""NO SUGAR""; however, the ingredients include sugar and corn syrup.  Well, it's simply delish, but it HAS SUGAR! I'd still buy it again though.  Actually, I bought all five flavors.  Just disappointed that the label is misleading."
2465,Neutral,Bad advertising,"I got my order very quickly. Thank you.<br />I thought the bars were bigger, as I have gotten them before, so a little more expensive compared to Costco, 1.7 oz bars, but I love them<br />Rita Power"
2466,Neutral,Mrs Mays Trio Bars,"When they arrive and are fresh, you can't beat them. When they arrive and are obviously old and out of date, you want to beat them just to avoid cracking a tooth. I am thinking about getting away from this product due to inconsistency with Amazon delivery and freshness.<br /><br />I would say: Buyer Beware"
2467,Neutral,Made in China,"The Trio Bars taste great,  however I will not purchase them again, the label clearly states product of China.  Too many issues with edible products made in China."
2468,Neutral,Not the best quality,"My family drinks a lot of coconut milk (about a can a day) and we have tried almost every brand out there.  This one tastes OK, but contains more preservatives than any other we have tried.  Unfortunately the ingredients are not listed here so I wasn't able to find that out until after my case arrived.<br /><br />For the price this Roland brand isn't a bad deal but I would recommend Chaokoh or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVIEG"">Natural Value Coconut Milk, 14-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> over this one.  Natural Value has no fillers or preservatives and tastes great which means it is perfect for making healthy coconut yogurt with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SUHY"">Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker</a>.  If you haven't tried making coconut yogurt yet I highly recommend it!<br /><br />A lot of people are still under the impression that Coconut milk is bad for you.  There was some faulty research done years ago on hydrogenated coconut oil which is mostly to blame for this.  If you are one of those people that still think coconut is bad I recommend reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416569502"">The Good Fat Cookbook</a> to help set the record straight."
2469,Neutral,"Good Price, Great Taste, Too many Ingredients","I ordered this thinking it was just coconut milk, but there are a few other ingredients in there as well. Next time I will pay more for the organic version, which reviewers have said has less added ""stuff."" But for the price you get a great tasting coconut milk that makes delicious ice cream. If you don't mind the extra ""stuff"" this is 5 stars."
2470,Neutral,Not the product I wanted,"Product description is not complete and clear. I ordered the wrong product. However, Amazon customer service is excellent and I got my refund after a phone call."
2471,Neutral,Damaged goods,"It's the same Chef Boyardee that I've loved since I was a kid, but about a third of the cans were dented.  Of those four were so badly dented that I was too cautious to eat them.  Sort of negates the savings from buying in bulk when I have to throw four cans away.  I may try this again hoping I just got a bad bunch.  Either they need to be more discriminant in their product selection, or they need more careful shipping and handling."
2472,Neutral,Okay taste,"I'm not sure why this taste so different from the Chef Boyardee regular Ravioli, but it taste more bland. It's still a cheap snack to have around though."
2473,Neutral,Slop for pigs,cheap if you have nothing else to eat. But if you have a sensitive stomach this slop is not for you.
2474,Neutral,Leave out the saturated Fats Please!,I liked raviolis as a kid and thought I would enjoy the childhood flavors again. Chef Boyardee Raviolis taste pretty good just like I remember. Really filling too! Usually when a product is really filling I know it has lots of fat and these raviolis were no exception. 3.5 grams of saturate fat! I'm not accustom to eating that much fat and they made we feel a little nauseous shortly after eating them. Lighten it up Chef Boyardee!
2475,Neutral,Not that good,"I eat Kippers all the time. I have found that there is no correlation between price and quality. These pretend to be from local fisherman in Maine.I am from Maine, I could not find this company until I went to Google Maps. These guys are inland, and buying this stuff from Canada and Europe. No problem with that but please do not BS us. There kippers are only OK. I like King Oscar better, and Polar after that. And both those are cheaper. I do like that they have a goodly sized portion, but I can eat two King Oscars for less than one of theirs. Just saying."
2476,Neutral,"They're fine, but not a quantum leap from what I can get in a supermarket.","Kippers are really fishy fish that are great if you love fish but can cause others (like wives) to run screaming out of the house.  I purchased these due to the other reviews, and because at the time the price for 12 6.7 oz cans compared very well to the price of 24 3 oz little cans at my local supermarket.<br /><br />However, the overall kipper experience wasn't really much different from the stuff I bought off the store shelves locally.  What I got what just what I expected, a can of soggy fishy tasting fish that gives me a lot of protien and if served with the right bread or cracker and some spreadable chive and onion cheese is quite a healthy snack if I'm hungry enough to want to eat it.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the pull tabs break off really easy on these, so even though you can't wait to dive into these cans of kippers, take it slow when you open them or you'll be digging around for your can opener."
2477,Neutral,Not as good as buying from the store,"I love these crackers, but I just received my first subscription shipment for these and I will probably not buy them again. There are an above average number of smashed crackers and they taste somewhat stale even though the expiration date is next year."
2478,Neutral,Mixed flavors not terribly appealing,"While both of the flavors (sharp cheddar & parmesan) are individually savory, the combined flavors were not great.  The first box I opened had a great number of broken and crumbled crackers, which resulted in the flavorings melding together.  In addition, the crackers had much more moisture than expected.  This moisture allowed the flavorings to mix further.<br /><br />The other three boxes were better - crisper and not as many broken crackers.  This allowed me to separate the crackers by flavor, which sort of defeated the ""Duoz"" concept.<br /><br />I had higher expectations and definitely would not have these again."
2479,Neutral,All mixed up,"These came and the crackers were all together in one container.<br />I thought the difference flavor crackers would have been in their<br />own container.  The flavors were okay, but hard to tell what the<br />flavor really was.  Very salty."
2480,Neutral,crushed cookies,We love the taste of the cookies/meringues and the price was better than at the store but many of the cookies were crushed which made them messy.
2481,Neutral,"Not bad, for Sugar Free","Let me say first that these aren't a bad snack food.  They have the all the sweetness and flavor you're looking for in a meringue cookie.  The problem comes in the fact that they don't ""finish"" well. That is, they tend to leave a gummy residue on the molars, which is easily removed by the tongue but still annoying. It does become an issue if you eat an actual ""serving size"" as you end up constantly removing that residue.<br /><br />I won't be ordering again."
2482,Neutral,"Tasty, but gummy at end. Good low cal alternative.","The taste very similar to the original vanilla, which I ordered just a little while ago. The do have that nice crunchy texture to start, but then end up gummy and sticks to your teeth. Not bad if you have a craving for them, but you will want to brush your teeth and floss after eating them and for some people they will hate the clingy fee. It's not really a problem for those who eat them by putting them in their mouth and letting them dissolve, more for those who munch on them."
2483,Neutral,"Great nutritional profile, tastes good with orange tea","These are made with mostly air and egg white and have a fantastic nutritional profile for bodybuilders and people losing weight or maintaining a weight loss.  I've lost 160 lbs through diet and exercise and like the reviewer who had surgery, I don't want to eat the amount of sugar found in normal meringues.  The fact there's a reasonable amount of protein in there is a bonus.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up I appreciate having a treat to bring to parties and dinners that I can both share AND eat, while staying within my daily nutritional target.<br /><br />I can find the chocolate ones in a grocery store 40 min from my home, but the vanilla ones nowhere.  This price beats the other online offers and you only have to buy 6 containers at a time.<br /><br />The chocolate meringues taste better by themselves than the vanilla, but paired with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIZ9O"">TAZO Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion Tea, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, the vanilla meringues are fantastic.  I bet they'd be good with other citrus teas as well.<br /><br />For example, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFM7U6"">Numi Tea Dry Desert Lime Herbal Tessan, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O9O"">Bigelow I Love Lemon Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />I wish they made other sugar free flavors, such as mint or cinnamon."
2484,Neutral,BEWARE! You only get 6 1oz bags!,"Grossly overpriced little bags of cookies. I was under the impression this was 6 packs of 6 bags each. But I only got one measly little 6x1oz package. The per ounce price noted is a fraud.<br /><br />....<br />But, Amazon did the right thing and offered me a refund of 5/6 of what I paid. Still, this item seem to be unclear with regard to how many you are actually getting."
2485,Neutral,blue buffalo dry food for puppies,"Nutritious, but my puppies did not like the flavor. I purchased a second bag hoping they would learn to like it, but they did not."
2486,Neutral,These are super skinny,"If you are used to buying the Piggy Twists that are about the size of fat cigars, these are not them.  These come 20 to a pack, but the individual twist is about as wide as a regular drinking straw, and 2/3 as long.  If you have a very small (as in toy breed) dog, they are probably great.  I have two dogs between 50-60 lbs., and these are barely worth pulling out of the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After using all the piggy twists (because I'd bought them), we are now used to this size and actually prefer them to the big cigar-like ones because they don't make such a mess.  I still think they are made for tiny dogs, but they will keep a 50-60 lb dog occupied for a while, too.  Just realize what size you are getting with this purchase, because the product picture does not make it clear."
2487,Neutral,Misleading Photo,"I thought we were getting the enormous bundle for the price I paid, which I thought was a deal. Instead it turned out to be a small pack of the twists. Could have gotten these in person for the same amount elsewhere."

Some crappy soil needs a boost, so trying to help out a little now, in the MN Fall...<br /><br />***Still not sure - the grass is very happy where the spike went in the ground - lots of new growth on the pines - and others, but is that becuase of the extremely wet spring thus far in MN??  Didn't hurt - I know that for sure!<br /><br />fyi, I used a 2x2 stake and pounded it into the ground to create a hole first, then dropped the spike into that. Otherwise, the spike gets pulverized trying to drive it in by itself, with that silly little plastic cap on it."
2490,Neutral,things you should know,"My dog is a finicky eater and in the stores when I bought the packets that come 4 flavors to a box, my dog loved the chicken and the turkey but none of the other flavors so buying just one box full of the flavor he liked seemed perfect. However, I had not fully read the ingredients before making the purchase. The good part is that it is all meat with no grains and my dog seems to have an allergy to many things which makes him finicky. BUT it has onion powder and garlic powder. Now these may make it taste better and the dog seems to enjoy but it also causes damage to his already weakened liver. Had I read the ingredients fully before even as finicky eater I would not have purchased because I know onion in any form is very dangerous to little dogs. Garlic not much better but worse for one with weakened liver already. So after having a package or two of his favs, he got sicker and has gastritis terrible..  had to go to vet and is still recovering so won't be using the rest of the packages.<br /><br />Read full ingredients before giving anything to your little guy and be sure he's able to digest these products.<br /><br />Now I just buy ground turkey and ground chicken, or whole, cook it up myself and give it to my little guy making certain there is nothing in the food that can cause him severe illness."
2491,Neutral,Too much alfalfa?,"We've tried several base mixes for our dogs' raw diet, and this one was one of the easiest to work with--the preparation steps couldn't be easier, and the wait time before serving is the shortest I've encountered yet. I also liked the packaging; it was very easy to store and didn't take up much space. However, our dogs weren't crazy about its smell and taste. It smells overwhelmingly like alfalfa and fruit, even after we mixed in the meat and some chicken broth to cut the odor. One of our dogs flat out refused to eat it. The other picked around the mixture or spit it out as he was eating his meat. I wanted to like this product, but the other flavors that had meat included (and less alfalfa) seemed much more palatable to our pups."
2492,Neutral,Tastes like nothing,"I give this 3 stars because it wasn't unpleasant coffee.  It just didn't taste like anything.  It reminded me of hot water with those Folgers coffee bags dunked in it for a little bit.  I don't like too strong a coffee but this was way underpowered for coffee.  I enjoy the bolder coffees, too, such as Coffee People Organic Bold and Dark Magic.  I would not buy Nantucket again."
2493,Neutral,Not What I Ordered,I ordered the Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend which I like as a smooth medium roast morning coffee.  I received the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend which is too mild for my liking.  Three stars for the coffee received. I won't order again from the Amazon marketing partner that sold it.
2494,Neutral,Can you recycle K-Cups???,Does anyone know if K-Cups can be recycled?  I cannot seem to find out.  I would be much more likely to purchase a coffee machine that uses K-Cups if I knew the cups could be recycled.
2495,Neutral,over priced,I had many a k-cup but at 1.29 a piece. I'll just take my refill cup to the store and let someone else make me a cup. I have bought k cups on sale for as little as .54 a piece. Green mountain is one of the better coffees but lets be realistic with the price huh.
2496,Neutral,k-cups,There ok have gone way up in price. Now that I have tried the Dunkin Donuts k-cups not sure if I will be going back to green mountain.
2497,Neutral,Nice coffee to start the day,"I enjoy starting the day with a cup of coffee. Once upon a time, I just used instant. Some were decent quality; some weren't. Then, I tried Mr. Coffee. Sorry, not my cuppa! Back to instant. Maxwell House had some nice instant.<br /><br />But my family wanted a Keurig coffee maker, so--for the holidays this year--I bought one. The coffee that came with it was a Newman's Own blend. Pretty bold and tasty (better than instant and quite a bit better than my memory of Mr. Coffee). I recently ordered this through Amazon. It is not quite as bold as the Newman's Own k-cup coffee. But it does have a smooth taste that starts the day off nicely. So, I have encountered two good coffees for the Keurig coffee maker!"
2498,Neutral,Great coffee but very pricey,Ordered this product without reading what i was getting ... dumb on my part.<br />My wife loves Nantucket Blend.  I mistakenly thought this was for 2 boxes of 24 k-cups because of the price.<br />Much cheaper to pick this great product up at Kohls or Bed Bath and Beyond if you have access to them.
2499,Neutral,Too acidic for my palate,"A matter of taste, I prefer darker, richer roasts. This one is lighter on the coffee aroma and flavor and heavy on the acidity. A true ""medium"" coffee, I would say."
2500,Neutral,"Dog Loves Them, Not So ""Fresh""","I have to say I was expecting a lot. I had been giving my dog Greenies but they were becoming outrageously priced. I thought I'd try these ones and admittedly, my dog loves them. The only problem is the treats stink. As in they smell, bad. I was hoping with a name like ""Freshies"" they would help with bad breath but so far they just seem to mask whatever he'd eaten before them. Don't get me wrong, they don't smell totally awful, I just had expectations of ""fresh"" not chicken smell."
2501,Neutral,"Pretty Good Tasting But Too High in Calories, Fat and Carbs For Me To Buy!","Let me start off by saying that I am not a big fan of granola bars but I enjoyed the big nut taste and peanut butter flavor in the Planters Big Nut Bar. On a taste basis alone, I'd give this product a 4-star rating. The only negative I had is that after eating it I was left with a quite dry taste in my mouth and had to drink a lot of water to get rid of it. If I wasn't a person who is trying to carefully watch my intake of calories, fat and carbs I'd be looking to eat Planters Big Nut Bar on a regular basis when I wanted a good tasting, high protein snack. However, given that each 1.62 oz. bar contains 220 calories (110 from fat), 13 grams total fat and 22 grams of carbs, I'd only give a 2-star rating to the nutritional qualities of this product; thus, resulting in my overall rating of 3 stars. While I liked the taste of the Big Nut Bar, the product's amount of calories, fat and carbs will prevent me from being a buyer on anything more than a very occasional basis. However, if you are not carefully watching these nutritional factors and you want a good tasting, high protein snack bar, than I think you will find that the Big Nut Bar will satisfy your needs."
2502,Neutral,Chewy Deliciousness,"I opened my Big Nut Bar to see what appeared to be a rice krispies treat coated at the bottom with peanut butter.<br /><br />After taking my first bite, I realized that the texture was far chewier then a rice krispies. This wasn't surprising, as dried peanuts are a bit tougher then rice krispies.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that the peanut bar was pretty tasty. However, it was a little to chewy for my taste. This should be avoided by all people who wear dentures, as one bite may take your teeth right off."
2503,Neutral,Bitter sweet,"These bars start out sweet when you first bite into them - almost like you're having a peanut butter sandwich. But then they leave a bitter after taste. On the plus side, it's really very nutty! But that bitter after taste is the main the reason why I don't like this product. And if that matters to you, I wouldn't buy this."
2504,Neutral,Not Nutty Enough For A Peanut Nut,"The binder ingredient in this large snack bar is crisped rice so it tastes like a ""Rice Crispy Treat"" with peanuts inside. The crispy rice forms the dominant texture of the bar.  An occasional peanut is not enough to give the rich meaty crunch of a handful of roast peanuts which I was expecting from the picture on the box.  The dominant flavor comes from the coating of sweet peanut butter on the bottom of the bar.  Because the sweetening is corn syrup, the bar is sweet but the flavor is not remarkable or distinctive.  Certainly the ""Double Peanut"" marketing implies one thing, but I find the bar disappointing and the peanut butter undercoat is messy in warm weather.<br /><br />However, there are worse snacks!  Each bar offers 100% of vitamin E, no cholesterol and no trans fats.  There's a reasonable amount of sodium and 7 grams of protein per bar.  A decent energy snack and a quick pick-me-up when the blood sugar is running low."
2505,Neutral,"Okay for a quick peanuty snack, but...","If you're craving a handy peanuty snack, then this will likely suit your tastes.  However, I found it a bit too sweet for the 'salty' I was looking for.<br /><br />While the package highlights 7gms of protein, don't think this is 'lean' protein.  With 13gms of fat per bar, you're packing away 20% of your RDA.  I was surprised at other contents as well.<br /><br />Pleasantly:<br />Sodium is 160gms (7%)<br />Carbs 22gms (12%)<br />Fiber 3g (12%)<br /><br />I expected all these numbers to be higher, so this swayed favor with me.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm not keen on the inclusion of corn syrup (though not hydrogenated) as an ingredient, but was happy that most of the rest of the listed ingredients were 'natural' in that I recognized the names. However, I'd hardly call this a 'granola' bar, as is listed on the packaging.  The 'granola' element is barely noticeable between the nuts and the peanut butter.<br /><br />I wouldn't plan on one a day to supplement my diet, but as an occasional quick and peanuty treat, it's not bad.<br /><br />My 3 year-old 'picky eater' niece enjoyed it too :)"

2507,Neutral,Unfortunately I'm Allergic,"These are the second distinctly nut-flavored meal or snack bars I've ever tried, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I did the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCKIBY"">Planters Big Nut Bars, Roasted Triple Nut, 8.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a> because it turned out that ""Double Peanut"" in this case meant peanuts and peanut butter, which I don't usually care for.  Anyway, I won't be ordering anymore because of a somewhat uncommon (and thus not specifically warning labeled about) food allergy.<br /><br />I'm extremely allergic to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXO0IU"">Canola Oil</a>, also known as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7L6C"">Rapeseed Oil</a>, which in me produces severe hives and swellings in the throat.  Fortunately, my allergic threshold is relatively high so that small amounts usually produce no reaction.  However, caution induces me to check labels and avoid it whenever I can; labels reading ""may contain one or more of the following vegetable oils:"" are the bane of my existence, asking me the question, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHQTE"">""Do I feel lucky?""</a><br /><br />Unfortunately, near the end of the ingredient list, near the end of the sub-list for granola is my old nemesis <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXO0IU"">Canola Oil</a>.  Consuming no more than a single bar per day and that not on consecutive days spared me any allergic reaction, but I will take no further chances when I am NOT obliged to write a review."
2508,Neutral,"Just ""Okay"" -- Definitely Big","These Planters Big Nut Bars are just so-so.  They're not sweet enough to be super-yummy, and not boring enough to be just normal peanuts.  They're right in between.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the sweeter taste of some of the other bars on the market such as the Nature Valley line.<br /><br />The size of these bars is pretty big, though, and certainly bigger than their competitors.  Too big?  I wouldn't say that.<br /><br />Size aside, they could have fit 5 extra bars in the packaging if they just turned them a different direction.  Odd.<br /><br />One complaint: the wrapping around the bars is difficult to open without: 1) tearing it into shreds, and 2) getting peanut butter all over your fingers.  I don't seem to have this problem with other bars of a similar nature.<br /><br />And as other reviewers have noted, these are far from being a ""healthy snack""... unless your alternative is a Pop Tart."
2509,Neutral,Just okay,"Planter's Big Nut Bars are basically bars of peanuts, sugar, granola, and crispy rice with a layer of peanut butter on the bottom. They're very chewy and pretty good, but I can only handle half a bar at a time.<br /><br />These ""healthy"" snacks are pretty high in calories, and I sometimes found them to be too sweet. I have a serious sweet tooth, but for some reason I couldn't really take all the sugar in these bars. I don't know if it's because Planters wants me to think that this is a healthy alternative to granola bars, and so my mind was rejecting the sugary sweetness, but I definitely could not finish a full bar in one sitting.<br /><br />I'm kind of impartial to the Big Nut Bars; it's definitely something that I won't go out of my way to get at the grocery store, but if it's on sale I would probably pick up a box."
2510,Neutral,Tasty But unhealthy,"Taste wise, These are great. Nutrition wise, That's where this falls shorts. When I Think ""Granola Bar"" Which these are falsely labeled as, I think of something that isn't an almost exact equivalent of a 2 pack of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMG8GU"">Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</a>, which nutrition wise, these are, give or take 10 calories.<br /><br />It's pretty much just a bar of peanuts with Corn Syrup and peanut butter. I'd say Stick with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMFXHU"">Planters Original Peanut Bar</a> or Snickers Munch or just plain Peanut Brittle. Those pack more of a great Crunch.<br /><br />Tasty Treat, which is why it gets 3 stars But Labeling it as a Granola bar - False advertising."
2511,Neutral,"Tasty, but high in fat and calories","I really like the taste of these -- but that taste comes at the price of a bar that is very high in fat, sugar, and calories.  Each bar contains 220 calories, 110 of which come from fat, and each one also has 12 grams of sugar, which is very high for a bar this size.<br /><br />Also, when my husband tried these, he wasn't too keen on the taste.  When I asked for his opinion on them, he just said that they were ""Meh.""<br /><br />Bottom line?  These are tasty, but certainly should be eaten in moderation.  Since I'm a health nut, I won't be buying these again."
2512,Neutral,Not Bad,"I actually prefer the Triple Nut version of this bar better despite the fact that I really like peanuts.  I think it is just a little bit too much like a candy bar for me to actually want to eat it too often and when I had one in my pocket for a few hours it got really messy because the peanut butter melted and got all over the inside of the wrapper and made the bar sticky and not that attractive looking, in fact it was a hot day when these were delivered so they were already pretty messed up before I even got them.  They do taste pretty good, so if you like things sweet, like peanuts and peanut butter and don't mind that they can get kinda messy, you would like this bar."
2513,Neutral,A pretty good treat,"I would never consider this a healthy option, but it tastes pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of peanuts and sugar since I prefer the peanuts and salty combination, so this snack is too sweet for me. And I should say that it's very dense and filling. I could barely finish my whole bar and finishing food is not normally a problem I have!"
2514,Neutral,Tasty but not that healthy,"FLAVOR<br />As everyone else agrees, this is pretty tasty. It is full of delicious nutty flavor. But, it barely has a hint of granola (in my opinion). Also, it is very filling. I only ate half of the first bar I tried because I was full thanks to all the nuts. Nuts, in moderation, are a good source of good fats.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL INFO<br />The bar is indeed big; about 30% bigger than regular granola bars. This 46 gram bar has 220 calories, no trans fats, 3 grams of saturated fats, 160 mg of sodium, 22 g of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, 12 grams of sugar, 7 grams of protein, a negligible amounts of calcium and iron, 100% of you Vitamin E daily value and 10% of your daily value of Phosphorous. It has no other vitamins. It also has 3.5 grams of  polyunsaturated fats and 6 grams of monosaturated fats.<br /><br />All these fats are not unhealthy. As I mentioned before, nuts are a good source of healthy fats. But, this bar may just a be too big for a regular snack.<br /><br />COMPARISON WITH A SIMILAR BAR<br />A single Planters bar is 220 calories, almost as much as a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7RDOC"">Clif Bar</a> (240 calories), but not as healthy. Why? The Planters bar has 110 calories from fat which equals to 13 grams of fat, 20% of your daily value. It also has 3 grams of saturated fats, which is not the best heart healthy choice. Whereas a Clif Bar has 7 grams of fat, 11 % of your daily value and 1.5 grams of saturated fats.<br /><br />Also, Clif bars are made with organic ingredients. Two of the first three ingredients of a Planters bar are: sugar and corn syrup. Doctors, nutritionists, exercise and health experts all tell you to avoid or reduce food items that have sugar and corn syrup in the first five listed ingredients.<br /><br />It also has artificial flavors AND more sugar (brown sugar, dextrin, fructose, evaporated cane juice, etc.). Yes, I know that Clif bars have 21 grams of sugar, but at least they are natural and organic based. Moreover, the Clif bar is full of vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Further, the Clif bar is recommended for people doing high intensity sports or requiring sustained energy: hiking, rock climbing, or any other sports.  This Planters bar being advertised as a snack.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />Is such a big bar truly necessary, especially for a snack? This bar makes me think of the McDonald's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVBO"">Super Size</a> idea. But, bigger is not necessarily better. A snack should not be so substantial high in calorie and fat content, unless you are about to go on a 8 mile hike or you are replacing an entire meal with this bar. As a snack, it is too much. I do not recommend as a regular snack.<br /><br />Full nutritional info below:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts - 1 bar - 220 calories, 12 grams of fat, 1.5 grams of saturated fat, 0 grams of trans fat, 3.5 grams of polyunsaturated fat, 6 grams of monounsaturated fat, 0 milligrams of cholesterol, 230 milligrams of sodium, 23 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, 13 grams of sugar, 7 grams of protein, 2% calcium, 100% vitamin E and 10% phosphorus.)<br /><br />Ingredients: Peanuts, Corn Syrup, Sugar, Peanut Butter (Roasted Ground Peanuts), Crisped Rice (Rice Flour, Sugar, Malt Extract, Salt, Caramel Color, Mixed Tocopherols (to Help Protect Flavor)), Evaporated Cane Juice Invert Syrup, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Fractionated Palm Kernel,  Oil, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Brown Sugar, Whole Grain Rolled Wheat, Coconut, Canola Oil, Wheat Bran), Partially Defatted Peanut Flour, Salt, fructose, Contains less than 1.5% of Sodium Caseinate (From Milk) Soy Lecithin, Resistant Corn Dextrin, Natural Flavor, Mixed Tocopherols (to help protect flavor)."
2515,Neutral,heavy stuff,"These bars were tasty, but extremely dense and heavy. I really had to chew! They are definitely filling, though, and taste pretty good. Probably a good breakfast for someone who needs fast protein and sugar."
2516,Neutral,These nut bars are making me thirsty!,"These nutty bars are huge compared to the average granola bar.  They actually taste pretty good too. They are definitely not a healthy type bar, more like a candy alternative.  The thing is covered with a peanut butter like coating on the bottom of the length of the bar which tastes great.  There are only 5 bars in the box, so I guess the large size is supposed to offset that.  I am a little on the fence, as they do taste good, but they aren't something I would normally crave for.  I do think they should be eaten with a drink nearby as they are a little on the dry side."
2517,Neutral,Not as great as they look,"Sure it sounds good and looks yummy on the box, but this is one mess of a ""candy"" bar. First of all, the peanut butter is all over the bottom (or is it the top?), so it forces you to use the wrapper or else. The flavor is a little more bland than I had expected as well. Overall, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rush out and buy any in the future."
2518,Neutral,Don't Forget to fix the Jug of Water While You Are At It..,"If you choose to have this salty/sugary snack bar, which is basically a candy bar, fix yourself a jug of water, you will need it.  I love Planters peanuts, but I prefer the old fashioned peanut bar, the real old fashioned one.<br /><br />My question is this:  Is it a granola bar, a nut bar, a candy bar, and I'm inclined to believe with the ingredients of 13 gms of fat, which is certainly not as much as some candy bars.  Then, there is a layer of peanut butter spread on the bottom.<br /><br />So, I don't think I would buy these if I had a hankering to fix the sweet tooth.  For the healthy side, no;  it's too sweet, too salty.  ...Rizzo"
2519,Neutral,"Great tasting, but it's more of a meal than a snack...","I recently got a chance to try the new(ish) Planters Big Nut Bars from Kraft Foods and I have to say that they're pretty darn good.  If you're into granola bars, these will be a little bit of a departure as you really don't get that kind of consistency.  These are also nuttier, and overall seem to be more akin to a nut-based candy bar like a Payday.<br /><br />As far as the pluses go, the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty, and though the consistency doesn't scream granola bar, it's just chewy enough that it also doesn't scream peanut bar (like the various brands of peanut brittle-esqe bars you tend to find in vending machines.)  The peanut butter coating on the bottom also has a nice consistency and taste, not chalky or too sweet like peanut butter tends to get in products like this.  Also, at 46 grams, it's pretty satisfying, and I'd think it would certainly make for a decent small meal on the go if you're in a pinch.<br /><br />There are some drawbacks though.  Mainly the bars can get a little messy where the peanut butter is concerned, so I can imagine it would be a nightmare with kids.  The bars are also pretty high in fat, which isn't as much surprising (they are peanut based), as it is unfortunate.  At 13g of fat per bar (3g saturated), these really are in the category of meal replacement, and not snacks.  If you're looking for a healthy snack I'd stick with a more basic granola bar."
2520,Neutral,"Good, but still needs work.","The taste of this product is very good.  It has that peanut buttery taste along with real peanuts for crunch.  The only thing is that it needs a bit more work.  1st of all, 220 calories!!!!  110 from fat!! Yikes.  For all you health nuts, this may not be the product for you.  2nd and most of all, you can't really eat this without getting your hands full of the peanut butter.  The bar is made up of nuts on the top with an underlayment of peanut butter on the bottom.  This means you can't eat the bar without the wrapper otherwise your fingers will melt the peanut butter and get all messy.  It would be better if the bar had the peanut butter ""sandwiched"" between two layers of peanuts.  Less mess and you won't need the wrapper."
2521,Neutral,Tasty offering for peanut lovers,"The ""big nut"" bars from Planters peanuts are exactly as promised: extremely nutty. They remind me of Paydays, but without the chocolate covering and the intense sweetness.<br /><br />Even though I love peanuts and PB, I'd probably only buy it if it were smaller or if the nuts were honey roasted...or if they had more than one flavor. They are a little too big for a mid-morning snack, and I'd definitely alternate this product with something else on a frequent basis."
2522,Neutral,"Not Bad, But Definitely Not the Best","Planters, of course, is the granddaddy of all peanut purveyors. They have been around forever and still put out the finest plain peanuts around.  I would have thought that their forays into the niche market of nut bars would be more successful.  Not so.  These Big Nut Bars are tasty, quite good, but honestly cannot compare with such products as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOCDA"">Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars, Peanut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>, to name one. As I try to put my finger on the difference, I think it is this--the Planters product is just too big. If you want a lot of peanuts, this is for you. If, however, you want something a little smaller but with a more nuanced taste and palette, go with Nature Valley or one of the other competitors.  Good luck next time, Planters."
2523,Neutral,An Example of Truth in Advertising,"These things are definitely big, definitely have peanuts and peanut butter, and they're chewy. But they're also rather boring. You REALLY have to like peanuts to be able to work your way through one. It feels like something's missing -- a little sweetness, a little salt -- not sure what it is, but something would help. I asked the techs on my production crew to test a couple. Bear in mind that they'll eat anything from a craft service table, but they also found them lacking in some essential ingredient.<br /><br />The bars also get a bit mushy to the point of being messy when warm.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of peanuts and peanut butter and that's all you want, then these bars are for you. If you need a little variety in your treats, then maybe go for something with a little chocolate or other added flavors.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I've hurt your feelings, Mr. Peanut. I've always been a big fan."
2524,Neutral,"Not for diets, good on taste","After receiving my box of Big Nuts bars from Amazon Vine, I eagerly tore into the box to get my first taste of this treat.  Expecting something more along the lines of a candy bar, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste: peanuty, definitely, with a slight sense of the granola bar that it is meant to imitate. They are not overpoweringly sweet, but the second and third ingredients in the label are sugar and corn syrup. At 220 calories a pop, they could easily be diet killers, including the 22 g of carbs each medium sized bar provides. Would I purchase these in the store? Probably not. Granola bars aren't my favorite thing. It was worth a taste, however."
2525,Neutral,"Melt in heat, and not the healthiest","Tasty, and healthier than candy bars, but a health bar it ain't (after peanuts, the next main ingredients are corn syrup and sugar).  The bars are currently a little over 50 cents a piece, which isn't bad for something to quench your hunger, which these little bars aren't too bad at.  That said, this deal is for about 5 lbs of peanut bars.  5 pounds of dry roasted, unsalted peanuts (which would be healthier than these bars) would only be a quarter of the price of these.  Maybe the convenience is worth it to you though.  Be aware that these bars do not do well in warm temperatures: the peanut butter they're smeared with gets melted very quickly."
2526,Neutral,"Tastes decent, not very good for you","These are good, but I will not order these again.  They taste like a payday granola bar, so good to substitute a candy bar, but not a good sub for a better snack or meal.  They are a bit messy and have some ingredients I normally avoid: corn syrup and more salt than I prefer.<br /><br />They are also very chewy; if you have complicated dental work, TMJ or issues with eating chewy foods -- you will want to steer clear of these."
2527,Neutral,"OK, but nuttin special","The peanuts were fine, but bland. The peanut butter was also bland.  Personally I could take it or leave it.  However, my girlfriend really liked them. She thought the combination of peanuts and peanut butter was great.  Calorie wise, they are average with a candy bar, and to be honest, I'd prefer a nutty candy bar with caramel."
2528,Neutral,"Sugar, sugar and more sugar!","Don't let words like ""chewy granola bar"" or ""7 grams of protein"" fool you into thinking that Planters Big Nut bars are any healthier than a candy bar.<br /><br />Check out the ingredients:<br />(in order)<br />1)peanuts<br />2)corn syrup(a sweetner)<br />3)sugar<br />4)peanut butter(roasted ground peanuts)<br />5)crisped rice(rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, carmel color, mixed tocopherols)<br />6)evaporated cane juice invert syrup(a sweetner)<br />7)whole grain rolled oats<br />8)fractionated palm kernal oil<br />9)granola(whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain rolled wheat,coconut, canolaoil, wheat bran)<br />10)partially defatted peanut flour<br />11)salt<br />12)fructose (a sweetner)<br />13)soy lecithin<br />14)resistant corn dextrin<br />15)natural flavor and mixed tocopherols<br /><br />Thats a lot of sugar when you add it all up with each 46gram bar (which really isn't that big) weighing in with 220 calories, 110 calories from fat, 13grams of fat, 22grams of carbohydrate, 3grams of fiber, 12 grams of sugar and 7 grams of protein.<br /><br />Inspite of all the sugar, I would have given a slightly better rating based on taste alone if I didn't get the impression Planters was trying to promote this product as something ""healthy"" instead of just another candy bar.  Consumers already have a difficult enough time wading through all the hype when trying to make healthy choices at the supermarket!"
2529,Neutral,Baraw Crow Bamas' Review: Planters Big Nut Bars,"Are there healthier choices for a snack bar? Yes. Are there better tasting choices for a snack bar? Yes. Is there a snack bar with more of a peanut taste? Eh, maybe. I wanted to suggest these for when you go hiking. However, with 220 calories, and 110 of those being fat calories, I'm not so sure I would suggest these for hiking. Factor in the 160mg of sodium, it seems counter productive. Health wise, I would suggest countless other bars. Taste wise, I don't see these bars replacing Blueberry Trio Bars in our snack drawer. As for peanuty taste, it's a toss up between these and a Payday bar. I would give the edge to the Planters Big Nut Bars just on the healthier factor.<br /><br />All in all, if you love peanuts, not worried about indulging, and don't mind a heavy feeling snack. Then by all means, this is a good choice for you."
2530,Neutral,Expensive and messy.,"You only get 5 bars in a box so the price comes out to almost .60 cents a bar, that's expensive.  Especially when it's just a glorified PayDay candy bar.  It does have 7g. of protein but also 22g. of carbs. so it's not a diet bar and it's not a low-carb bar.  It also doesn't compare to a nut and granola bar, the granola in this bar looked like oats covered in a sugar glaze.<br /><br />It tasted good on the start but by the finish it had a fake, burnt peanut taste, almost like rancid oil.  Apparently my box had gotten too hot because the coating of peanut butter that is on the bottom of the bar had melted and it was a mess inside the wrapper.  This would not be kid friendly in the car.  It would be a great big mess.<br /><br />I would pass on these for the cost and nutritional information alone.  But then combined with the peanut butter coating on the bottom (!) it's definitely a no-go."
2531,Neutral,Just average...too chewy and sweet,"I'm a fan of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCKIBY"">Planters Big Nut Bars, Roasted Triple Nut, 8.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, so I was thinking these would be similar, only with all peanuts.<br /><br />That wasn't the case...<br /><br />These are more difficult to chew and more chewy than I like.  They also have lots of sweetners included (in order): corn syrup, sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, brown sugar (in granola), fructose to add up to 12g per bar.  This is actually 1g less than the triple nut, so I'm not sure why I notice it more with these...<br /><br />Overall, they are ok, but I wouldn't put them on my shopping list."
2532,Neutral,A Dentist's Dream,"I have a sweet tooth or two and love chocolate....but despite that I found these cookies to be over-the-top sweet. (Sugar is the first ingredient on the package.) I will stick to a chocolate bar to satisfy my gluten-free chocolate cravings after these are gone.<br />If you plan to buy these, you may want to know that there are 9 cookies in each box. All of mine arrived broken and crumbled (not sure why since no previous problems with having food shipped to me by Amazon) but still taste good."
2533,Neutral,Good choco flavor; otherwise lacking,"As a gluten-free chocoholic, I will say that these are the best mass-produced, gluten-free chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have found.  The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor.  The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing.  The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4""), dry, and brittle.  That's rather surprising given their fat content:  a whopping 9g per serving.<br /><br />If you're a baker, you're better off making your own.  But if you're not a baker and you love dark chocolate, these might be right up your alley."
2534,Neutral,They melt in the heat!,"I really like these cookies. They are a chocoholic's dream. Just be aware if you order them when it's hot, get the fastest shipping you can or they melt inside their packages and make a tasty mess."
2535,Neutral,Fair,"These cookies would be better if the base dough recipe was the same as the Extreme Chocolate Mini Cookies with the addition of dark chocolate chunks.  As they are, they are more sweet than chocolate, and shouldn't in any way be considered a ""dark"" chocolate.  They aren't bad, they just aren't what is expected by the product description.  They also arrived more crumbled than intact, a problem classic in gluten-free baked goods that can be easily corrected by tweaking the recipe.  This is not one of this line's best offerings."
2536,Neutral,"Tiny, sugary,  overpriced but taste good....","Ultra tiny to be paying about $1 for a pack of 2.  Really not worth the price.  Sugary, somewhat crispy and very chocolaty but I was hoping for more melty chocolate pieces...disappointed in finding one or two per cookie.  Every cookie had part melted onto the wrapper or had one broken.  It was fun trying but way overpriced.  I won't repurchase."
2537,Neutral,Shipping and packaging problem,The cookies came crumbled into many pieces in 3 of the boxes I opened.  Also the chocolate chips had melted onto the cellophane.
2538,Neutral,Cookies are just ok,"I was a little disappointed with this product. I am a big Pamela's Products fan, but these were just ok."
2539,Neutral,doenst work to reheat/defrost right in jar or glass container,"I think this machine is nice and the steam and blend cycle is nice but it takes an insignificant amount of extra time to dump food from basket directly into the blending container in the Beaba.  So as far as this difference I don't really think it is significant enough to go with the Brezza.  Beaba now makes a larger machine also.  I guess the cost is a little less for the Brezza but because of the disadvantage I am about to mention it absolutely does not work for me!  I chose the Beaba because you cannot put your jar or small glass container right into the Brezza to defrost or reheat like you can with the Beaba because of that middle rod that is part of the blades.  It is completely in the way in my opinion and they force you to use their plastic containers to store and reheat food!  I freeze my baby food in these tiny glass lock containers because I try to use glass when I can for storage.  I also buy the glass organic pre made baby food when I don't have time to cook as a backup and I need to be able to warm those since the baby doesn't eat the whole jar yet so I store left overs in the refrigerator.  You can put the jars and the glass containers directly in the Beaba basket to defrost and heat and I could not use the Brezza to do it.  I would have to defrost at room temp or in fridge then transfer to heat which takes way too long and I would have to transfer to the brezza containers which are plastic and then heat.  Not only this is completely time consuming (I do not use the microwave it irradiates your food, destroys nutrients and it is horrible!) it is also plastic and even though BPA free I am trying to avoid plastic like I mentioned so just steaming and blending in plastic is already too much for me so for storage I use glass only.  So this is a good machine but if you are looking for defrost/reheat function where you can put your own containers and jars into this machine will not work."
2540,Neutral,Best for smaller quantities,"When I made baby food I liked to make massive quantities, freeze them in ice cube trays, and store them in Gallon storage bags.  After using the Baby Brezza for a few months it stopped working.  The company quickly sent me a replacement part, however during that time I realized it was much easier to just steam fruits and/ or veggies on the stove and process in a food processor.  It was a much more efficient method.<br /><br />The 'set it and forget it' motto is nice, however it cannot be used with every food.  Most fruits (apples and pears for example) have to be drained after steaming and before processing.  This means you can't just set it and foroget it.  Certain vegetables (broccoli) require adding water prior to processing.<br /><br />This product would probably be best for making smaller quantities and if you don't already have a food processor.<br /><br />It also comes with great recipes which are all from (...)"
2541,Neutral,"Good product, but it broke after 2 months","I used the Baby Brezza for about 2 months and it broke. It was good while it lasted - very easy to use.  A couple issues I did have with it -<br />1) It is difficult to remove the blender attachment. It seemed to be easiest to remove while hot but you have to be careful not to burn yourself in the process. Otherwise, it took a lot of force to pull out the attachment.<br />2) It broke after two months - it was the plastic part that helps to hold the middle rotor on the bottom. I didn't use this that often - probably 3-4 times every week since my baby just started solids and there were a few things I just mashed up instead of using the Baby Brezza.<br /><br />I had intended to get this replaced through Baby Brezza but saw that it would cost $10 for me to ship it back to them - since this seemed like poor manufacturing on their part, I didn't want to pay to have it shipped back to them. I contacted Amazon and they provided me with a postage paid shipping and refunded the money very promptly.<br /><br />I ended up buying a pressure cooker and using my food processor which seems to work just as well - it does mean using more pots/items which means a little bit more clean up but it's actually faster and I can make larger batches of food."
2542,Neutral,Finally got it fixed.,"Update: Thanks to the wonderful folks at Lowe's they got the stripped screws out of the bottom of the item, and I purchased some new better quality screws to put back in it. Now that my item is fixed, I still will not give this product 5 stars, just because I do not think it is worth its cost.  I think as easy as the belt comes on and off that is something that should be addressed whenever the company goes to make a newer model.<br /><br />Received this off my wishlist for Christmas and was excited to use it, it steamed the veggies just fine, however it would not blend. The blade and its unit inside the baby food maker would not spin. I noticed other people on here have had the same problems. I tried to call the Baby Brezza company at 9:23 am EST since on their website it says their business hours are 9-5 EST. However their automated system would not let me speak to a customer service representative, you have to leave a message. Sorry, I want to talk to some one and NOT wait to be called back at YOUR convenience, but rather MINE. I gave them their chance, so I now have to wait to receive the Amazon invoice in the mail from my mother since she is the one who purchased it here on Amazon for me, and then I will be printing a FREE shipping label and returning with ease through Amazon. I was really looking forward to this baby food maker, however, I think I am going to be going with a different brand. This thing is a piece of crap. IT is so disappointing to try to make your baby food and to have this thing not work; on top of that, their customer service has disappointed me too."
2543,Neutral,Great...when it doesn't break! Good Customer service.,"I got this baby food maker off of my baby registry. I wanted to make my baby's food so I knew what was going into his mouth. Well, it worked great the first few times and then the plastic broke off the bottom of the container that holds the metal pin in (holding in the blade.) I was able to rig it so that it still worked anyways. Then, a couple days later while making a batch of prunes, the motor went out! Well, surely this was designed to handle something a little thicker like prunes.<br /><br />So, I called and emailed the baby brezza company. About a week later, they did call me and ended up sending me a brand new machine for no charge to me. But, in the meantime I steamed the food in my steamer and used my food processor. I loved that SO much more because I could do large batches. So, I think I may return the brezza. If you want to make food in tiny batches, this would be great. But, I found that a food processor and steamer are much more efficient for large amounts of food to freeze. So, 3 stars (being generous) for the machine and 5 stars for their customer service if it breaks :)"
2544,Neutral,"blade broken, then fixed, now works quite well","Received this as a Christmas present. Just like other reviewers noted, the item was never functional. The food was steamed, but the blade doesn't turn because the motor isn't engaging the turning knob. Not worth my time to fix a machine that never worked. Will get the Baby Cook instead.<br /><br />OK, update on this product. I found a blog by searching for the product name in Google and something like ""blade doesn't turn"" and found a fix-it explanation that worked great. Another review on Amazon also has the way to fix this. So after taking 15 minutes to find a good fix, and 10 minutes of taking apart, fixing the band that connects the motor to the blade axis, and putting it back together, the Brezza works great. We have made all kinds of foods in the Brezza including carrots, apples, broccoli, pears, peas. All these items streamed well and pureed well too. However, we still do yams and squash in our immersion blender because the brezza seems to have a little trouble with those items.<br /><br />I'd give it four stars but I took off one for the fact that I had to fix it upon arrival. I hope the company has indeed altered it's design to stop the bands from slipping off during shipping."
2545,Neutral,Good but not great,"I have been using this device for the last three months. I feed my baby almost exclusively homemade foods (besides those my doctor recommends to buy in a jar), so I do use this quite a bit.<br /><br />It is easy to use and it is convenient. My only complaint is the construction. Some of the materials seem a little cheap (for example, the button panel is starting to come off...it is just a sticker). I'm already having to buy another container because the plastic broke on my first one. I called the company to talk to them about it (because it seemed fishy to me that it would break so quickly under normal use, and there is supposedly a warranty) and I got a machine (during normal business hours). No one returned my call. I truly think that any company who makes things for people with babies need to have excellent customer service because their customers are sleep deprived and short on time. This company doesn't even come close to meeting a high standard. I'd rather pay the $25 for the replacement part than deal with the hassle.<br /><br />So, basically, I like the device but I'm not crazy about the quality or customer service (the latter is basically non-existent at this point).<br /><br />All this being said, I researched several other machines before buying this one. I'm not sure I would go back and buy a different device. At least I can buy replacement parts easily!<br /><br />UPDATE: The replacement part didn't fit as it was a newer model than my machine. However, the customer service department did call me back and shipped me an entire new machine (newer model). Unfortunately, it still seems plauged with some problems. The drive shafts sometimes sticks and the buttons don't work very well. Ulimately, for me, not a worry-free machine."
2546,Neutral,frustrated but its a good product.,A good product but I received one and the puree function didnt work sent it back and ordered another one. 2nd one had the same problem. I figured if two that I received had the same problem I must not be the only one.  I read reviews and saw that others were saying take the machine apart and put the black belt back on. We did that and now it works like a champ. Whatever the cause of the issue they need better quality control.
2547,Neutral,Old Jelly,"Product was old. The chocolate was brittle, stale and easily sheared off from the jelly. Not the Jelly Rings I remember from childhood."
2548,Neutral,Ummmm UM!!,As always Joyva is the BEST! My ONLY reason for not giving this a higher rating is the bottom layer was stale.  The rest was incredibly delicious!
2549,Neutral,Not so Tender...and Very Dry,"I purchased this as an option for my cat since he only eats chicken. This is a much drier and diced product (no juice) as compared to the other Whiskas products in a pouch. However, the pouch is quite stuff, so if you cat likes it, he will surely get enough to eat from this pouch. Also, the picture does not look like the product I was shipped."
2550,Neutral,Too much aftertaste,"We eat mostly gluten free as one of my kids has a sensitivity to it. While I try to bake all the goods myself, these looked like a good thing to carry as a snack when we travel. My daughter didn't like the cookie part much. SHe kept trying to pick out just the chocolate chips.<br /><br />For myself, it was OK. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can have a grainy aftertaste and that was the case with these. The upshot was they make an excellent cookie crumb pie crust when you toss them in the food processor and grind them up."
2551,Neutral,"cookies: shortbread, choc. pecan",its nice to have them individually wrapped. the taste is ok but a little chemical taste in the parts without chocolate chunks. each individual would have to try for themselves. they will keep easily due to individual wrapping.
2552,Neutral,Can you say Wii are overrpriced?,"Another overpriced Wii product. Needs to be $1-$1.50 each not the 3.00 they cost me including shipping. Other than that, these are a great product. A bit too expensive for party favors which would be the proper target group."
2553,Neutral,Great idea - bad flavors,"I believe that these were a great idea, however the flavors were not all that great, I couldn't even get my picky 3 year old to try them, my older daughter tried them and said that they were not that bad at first but started to taste icky after a while. I think if these were in regular flavors that it might have been an easier sell to my child."
2554,Neutral,"Great product, but over priced.","I agree with the other reviewers that kelp noodles are definitely a delicious and nutritious noodle substitute. But $10.95 is absolute ridiculously over priced. I live in Manhattan and buy the same product in H market in Korea Town for $2.99. I recommend this product, but not for this price. If you live in a metropolitan city I would suggest purchasing kelp noodles at any major Asian market for a fraction of the price listed here."
2555,Neutral,ok for the taste,I have looked everywhere for powdered milk that is not fat free and finally found it! Sent it to my cousin away at college and he says it's ok for the taste. Good for late night dorm snacks.
2556,Neutral,good taste but high sucrose content,"The milk powder is very sweet and definitely not natural taste. High amount of sucrose added in,which lower the cost.(Sucrose is much cheaper than milk)<br /><br />The taste is good though. For 12 dollars, it is not bad."
2557,Neutral,WOW!,"I was about to make another purchase on this milk. I was going to do the monthly shipment. I'll never buy this again when it's cheaper elsewhere....It's a fantastic product, but too bad the price doubled like that..I just paid 13 for this....What happened??"
2558,Neutral,Chewing gum,"this is a good product for people who like gum but have dental work to which most gum sticks.<br /><br />I've ordered from Amazon because they have the best price for bulk purchases; I save almost 40% off per-pack retail prices.<br /><br />There is potential for a problem; Wrigley dates each of its bulk packages with a best by date. Generally, Wrigley gum is 'fresh' if the best by date is 6 months or more in the future. Current shipments from Amazon are dated 5/9/09; this is only 2 months away. There is potential to receive stale product; Amazon would most likely accept a return but we don't buy things with the expectation we will return them."
2559,Neutral,Tasteless!,This would be great for someone who just wants to freshen their mouth for a few minutes. Would not recommend for those looking for long-lasting taste.
2560,Neutral,not made in the USA,"Hi. I just wanted to point out two things about these chews. First of all, they are made in Mexico not the USA. Therefore, the ingredient list is misleading when it says ""American"" beef hide because it is meant to make you think that the beef hide is from the United States of America. More accurately, it should read, ""North American"" beef hide to distinquish it from being from Asia (note, the label does not specify the origin of the hydrolysed vegetable protein which could be wheat gluten). Secondly, these chews do not contain chlorhexidine like the ""C.E.T"" brand and this may be an ingredient you want if your dog has peridontal issues. My dogs like these chews and I think they do help to a small extent to clean the teeth. gb"
2561,Neutral,A bit high priced,"This is a high price for a two ounce tin of mint fragments.  The flavors are OK.  They are sweetened with xylitol which does not promote tooth decay and has some benefits as it supresses the growth of bacteria.  I guess you could call them small breath mints.  The small size tin can be carried in a purse, shoulder bag, or coat pocket (as long as you are not flying on an airplane)."
2562,Neutral,Eh,"Although I love coconut oil and know of all the benficial ways to use it, this coconut oil tastes too coconutty for me.  I have to agree with other reviewers in that the smell is so strong it almost seems like an artificial scent. I dont mind coconut flavor and scents but this is almost too much.  It almost makes me gag.  I'll be going with Nutiva next time."
2563,Neutral,Food Product Review,The coconut oil arrived in good condition.  It had a stronger taste than conventional cooking oils that I did not care for.
2564,Neutral,Great. Who would pay $6.99 plus shipping for something that costs less than 50 cents?,Great cheap soda. Worth every penny of the $.47 cents that it costs. Not worth $6.99 plus shipping.
2565,Neutral,Dog is not a fan,"My dog loves the chicken, steak, and peanut butter booda bones, but he's not as fond of the spearmint/peppermint variety.  My dog will eat it if offered, but my dad's dog who I often sit for will not even touch these.  I wouldn't recommend for a dog who prefers meat."
2566,Neutral,"OK, but the Golden Valley brand Organic is better","I bought this product and the Golden Valley Natural Organic (Original) in order to compare them.  They're exactly the same price per ounce (the Golden Valley product is organic; the John Wayne organic is more expensive).  They're similar, both fall into the ""soft"" beef jerky category with no artificial ingredients.  However, the John Wayne product is a bit mealy and has a subtle but funny aftertaste.  This outweighs the single shortcoming of the Golden Valley product, which is that it is a bit too sweet."
2567,Neutral,"Okay, not the best","We heard this was the best stuff out there, Ordered and weren't all that excited. If you like a softer product this will be good, We ordered the teriyaki, good flavor odd texture. We are jerky fans, b ut won't order more of this, Our local guy gets our business."
2568,Neutral,Needs more filling!,These cookies come in super cute packaging- but what they have in looks they lack in filling! The cookies themselves are tasty but they could definitely step it up and add more filling inside of each one. I expected it to be jam packed with filling but it only had a little squeeze of it (imagine a pea size drop inside a quarter).<br />I would eat these again if I was starving...but it definitely would not be my first choice.
2569,Neutral,Van Houtte Colombian K cup,Van Houtte coffee is one of my favorites but this medium roast has a little less kick to it than I had hoped.
2570,Neutral,Van Houtte Colombian,A nice mild coffee but not the best Colombian I have tasted.  Diedrich is still the better choice for me.  I don't think I would purchase this brand again.
2571,Neutral,quick easy not as tasty as my own recipe,"I love this companies flour and many of its products.  Pasta is great. Sauce not so much, for me. It is the color and strong taste."
2572,Neutral,"It's ok, Knorr's is better","Knorr's comes the closest to resturaunt quality Hollandaise sauce. Aunt Penny's was okay, a little too much tanginess for my taste, not enough creamy butteriness. But, it's still better than making it myself and the store was out of Knorr's. I haven't tried Wagner's or Reese yet."
2573,Neutral,Smells good,"This coffee smells so autumn, makes a pleasant cup of seasonal coffee, a little on the weak side, but good."
2574,Neutral,"It would be great, if it wasn't for the poops","I love the taste of these bars, but the poops always come within 30 minutes of eating just one.  It's not just poops, but crazy poops.  Still... I eat them, but I make sure I am alone at home and near a bathroom.  Those who aren't effected must have intestines of steel.  Co-workers and I were speaking about these bars this afternoon.  I'd asked if any of them had ever eaten them and, if so, what kind of side-effects resulted.  After all the embarrassed smiles and giggles, I didn't have to ask further.  Maybe they could reduce the fiber just a little?  Otherwise, the Chocolate Peanut Butter is the best."
2575,Neutral,So good and so bad,"The Good:  Fiber One Bars taste great, are high in Fiber, and are a filling snack between meals<br /><br />The Bad:  Causes extreme gas, like nothing I have eaten before, and some minor stomach cramps."
2576,Neutral,Fun for all ages!!!,"The reviews of this extraordinary product pretty much cover the bases.  Tasty?  Check.  Full of fiber?  Check.  Causes extreme gut pain?  Check.  Causes nonstop farting like you were born in New Jersey?  HELL YEAH.<br /><br />What can I add to this?<br /><br />Well, a few months back my coworkers and I drew up a contract for a spirited competition.  The contestants were to eat three bars back to back with plenty of fluid at breakfast.  The winner would be determined by the last person to use the bathroom.  Unfortunately during a test run where I consumed three bars in one sitting, I discovered that even tapping out and running at a full sprint to the bathroom was too much of a risk - especially at work!  Thank GOD I was wearing  my Ex Officio Give-N-Go Briefs!  That at least contained the rush that I experienced.<br /><br />We devised a different sport to compete in.  Eat one bar and then 30 minutes later go to the gym and use the elliptical machine.  You win in one of two ways:  1.  Hold out and do not pass gas at all during a 20 minute workout. However you can also win by passing enough gas to drive your competitors off of their machines.  So even if you tap out early you can still win.<br /><br />It is critical to use the elliptical during this challenge due to the rapid cheek movement it causes.<br /><br />I gotta stop eating these things.  No one wants to sit near me anymore."
2577,Neutral,Any real peanuts in the bar?,"I just had my first bar drawn from our kitchen cupboard. It was the Oats and Peanut Butter bar.  I was attracted by the full-sized peanuts on the package photo.  About halfway through I realized that I hadn't yet tasted a peanut.  Even the peanut butter flavor was pretty weak.  Looking back at the package I realized that the photographer had placed full sized peanuts in the photo to make it LOOK like they were part of the bar.  Old time deceptive advertising.  You wouldn't think they'd need to do that still.  But then, we are easily fooled... aren't we?"
2578,Neutral,cheaper @ the warehouse store,i love these bars! I was sad to find out that I spent almost 2x as much as I could have - the warehouse store had it for 9.99 for 30.
2579,Neutral,Hoemel Compleats,Used to take to work for lunch. Tastes OK but is not real filling and a bit bland. Still a good idea for a quick meal.
2580,Neutral,I like vanilla.,"It adds a nice sweet flavor to my coffee.  I combine it with a little spoonable Stevita.  Better than Starbucks.  Its sweeting strength is a little weaker than I anticipated, but it will still last maybe 3 months because I combine it with the spoonable Stevita.  I iniatially used it without the spoonable stevita, but didn't like the taste.  Combining it is perfect.  For a 12oz. cup of coffee I use about 1/4 tsp. of spoonable Stevita and 7 drops of this van.liquid Stevita and some almondmilk for the cream."
2581,Neutral,Disappointing,I bought it as a substitute for powder Stevia hoping for better after-taste.<br />I am disappointed. The dropper design is faulty and I can't get drops in the coffee with out getting some on my fingers - an avoidable waste.<br />I also found that one needs to use more than a few drops to get the sweet taste.<br />The powder form is more economical if somebody makes half-packets of powder?
2582,Neutral,It will do.,"It is difficult to review food items because everyone has taste preferences that vary.  I purchased this because I wanted some sort of sweetener for my coffee that would not affect my blood sugars. I found the flavoring to be a bit overpowering.  I ended up using less than the recommended amount.  I only use one drop in my coffee. I would suggest you start with one drop and then taste and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />To me the vanilla flavor tastes artificial but you can't find any information on the label other that it contains ""natural"" flavoring.<br /><br />But it does what it promises which is to sweeten and flavor. It will also last for a long time since only drops are used."
2583,Neutral,Good but...,"Maybe my expectations were too high. Heeding the warnings about adding too much I started with 8 oz of bottled seltzer and added a few drops. The taste was more of a hint than a true flavoring so I added a little more, figuring if I got the taste I liked I'd start from scratch and get a better measurement. It never happened for me. When I added enough to create some flavor I also found an aftertaste that was somewhat alcohol-y. Not a problem for most people but I strongly dislike the taste of alcohol so it's not good for me. Played with it some more and never got a satisfactory result. Into the fridge, back of the shelf.<br /><br />A couple of weeks later I came home with some diet orange soda. Thought I'd try it again and see if I could make some orange cream soda and voila! Delicious. I say this having only tried one 8 oz serving and I made it a little too sweet but I have no doubt that once I get the ratio correct I'll add this to any orange soda I drink from now on. I'll probably try it with other flavors too altho orange seems to be the sure thing."
2584,Neutral,Vanilla isn't my flavor,"I have tried the vanilla on cereal, in a smoothie and I don't really like the flavor.  It seems too bland to me.  I don't know that I would purchase it again.  I think it is a matter of what a person likes.  I have never liked Vanilla  ice cream either so that is probably just me."
2585,Neutral,Less is more,I purchased liquid stevia in an effort to use more natural sugars in my baking. I tried simply replacing white sugar with liquid stevia in my favorite recipes. I went to Sweet Leaf's website and used their conversion chart. I found that 1 tsp of liquid stevia for every 1 cup of sugar was too much. The intial taste was ok but had a strong aftertaste that stayed in your mouth for awhile. I later tried recipes specifically calling for liquid stevia. These recipes tasted quite good and typically used less liquid stevia.
2586,Neutral,Just ok to me,I had read other reviews on this product and really was looking forward to trying them. I have to say I was alittle disappointed they are really just ok to me nothing fantastic.
2587,Neutral,not sure how old,"I've used liquid stevia for over 5 years and have used 2 brands. I like the Sweet Leaf brand the most and have had the most experience with that brand.  When Sweet Leaf liquid stevia is new, it is a perfectly clear liquid.  Although I'm not sure why, when it ages, it turns a caramely brown color although it retains its taste and effectivness.  I purchased the Vanilla Creme (my favorite in plain Greek yogurt) on Amazon to save time in running to our health food store 40 minutes away.  The transaction was great and shipping was fast.  However, when I opened them, they were already caramely brown, which indicates to me that their stock is old, which is why I gave the review only 3 stars.  Although everything else was just fine, I think I will stick to getting it from my health food store to ensure the highest freshness (because it lasts such a long time anyway)."
2588,Neutral,Didn't taste as good as I expected,I needed some sugar-free sweetner for my coffee and I wanted it to be flavored. I was hoping that this product would meet that need but I was a little disappointed in how much after-taste there was. I still use it but not as much as I would if it tasted better.
2589,Neutral,"Good in moderation, but can be bitter","This is by far (in my opinion) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line. The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking, coffee, tea etc. The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something. I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper. Otherwise, you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet.. bleck.. bitter city."
2590,Neutral,not too bad,"I use this stuff pretty much anywhere--coffee, tea, plain water, oatmeal, you name it. It's tasty and cost-efficient.<br /><br />My one complaint is that, more than a few drops, and you get a really noticeable aftertaste, kinda like alcohol or something burnt. This stinks because I occasionally like to make really sweet coffee for dessert, but the aftertaste is horribly distracting."
2591,Neutral,good product,"My German shepherd (mix) has ear problems, right around this time of year he developers ear wax problems build up. I wash his ears constantly, but still the bacteria seem to re-grow and developed ear infection."
2592,Neutral,Does sweeten but leaves aftertaste,"Got this hoping to cut back on my creamer/Splenda consumption for sweetness! It does sweeten, you can add as little or as much as you want with the dropper. It does taste ok, although you do NOT get a big vanilla flavor with it, but that is ok too. My only problem, it does leave an aftertaste. Maybe it is me because I am so used to my creamers, but I had my daughter try it and she had one too. I guess I will stick to my creamer/Splenda for now. Would love to retry if they can work on the aftertaste problem."
2593,Neutral,Vanilla Creme Stevia,"It took about 8 drops for coffe and 16 for green tea (green tea has a bad taste anyways, so its not the stevia's fault). The vanilla scent was really nice and relaxing. I'd choose this better than the unflavored stevia."
2594,Neutral,good in coffee,"I have just recently discovered Stevia (in powder), then I tried the liquid, then I tried this flavor.  I have to say this is pretty good...but I like the flavorless liquid better.  I havent used it to bake or sweeten any foods, but I can give it high praise in coffee & tea."
2595,Neutral,Kind of an odd flavor!,"I love the Sweet Leaf stevia, but the Vanilla Creme isn't one of my favorites. It's an odd flavor and doesn't taste very vanilla-y to me. If you are new to Sweet Leaf, I recommend trying a different flavor: my favorites are Rootbeer, English Toffee, and Cinnamon."
2596,Neutral,This particular product is decent when mixed with other fruits!,Not as sweet fruits work the best for me when making smoothies using this product. I usually blend protein with this stuff with water and blueberries. If you're looking to really make a healthy drink try mixing in a tablespoon of Green Vibrance with each smoothy.
2597,Neutral,Better than liquid color - not as good as paste,"I've used liquid and paste color in the past and this product seems to be somewhere in between.  I had to use quite a bit of the substance to achieve the color I was looking for.  In paste colors, you get a dramatic result with just a drop.  The Ateco are quite a bit better than the liquid color, and, for the price, it's probably about right.<br /><br />The bottom line - You get what you pay for.  If you want dramatic colors, you can achieve that using a good portion of the bottle.  If you want subtle colors, this may be what you're looking for."
2598,Neutral,Muted colors,"I purchased these colors to replace the Wilton gel colors, many of which I find give my icing an off taste.  These do not affect the taste of my icing, so get stars for that.  But, while they are stronger in hue than the cheap, liquid colors, they are not nearly as intense as the gel colors.  I had to add quite a bit of red and blue to acheive purple, and even then, it wasn't a very vibrant shade.  I would recommend simply due to the taste issue, however."
2599,Neutral,Not good for Easter egg coloring,"I bought this set because my niece was obsessed with having a black Easter egg (kids!) long story short, even though I used an entire bottle the coloring of the eggs were not vibrant. Not sure how they would work for baking so that's why they are still getting 3 stars."
2600,Neutral,"This is the same product as Americolor,apparently","I just bought this set and I have not had the chance to try it, though I'm looking forward to it.  However, I just wanted to note that to my surprise, one of the dyes actually had the ""AmeriColor"" label on it, which I thought was a completely different brand of food coloring.  It was leaf green from AmeriColor rather than green from Ateco.  Furthermore, the bottles were all completely identical between the Americolor and other Ateco bottles in the bo.  I don't know if maybe they just remove the labels from AmeriColor bottles and add Ateco labels?  At any rate, you can save a few bucks by buying the cheaper AmeriColor since I think it's pretty clear that they are the same thing..."
2601,Neutral,Some colors better than others,"I am an avid macaron baker (the French macarons not the American ones.) I've had some problems with the yellow messing up my shell batter.  I feel like the color is not as intense, therefore I have to use more of it to get the desired color.  I'd been using the limited range of powdered colors that I have, and thought that switching over to the gel stuff would be okay but it has been troublesome for me.  Regardless, the colors (save yellow) are bright and vibrant."
2602,Neutral,Don't use to color white chocolate or candy coating,"I bought these to color the coating I use for cake pops. With either melted white chocolate or the Wilton Candy Melts, both seized up when I added the gel coloring. I was able to get pastel colors okay without seizing but when I tried for a more vibrant look, it clumped so badly, I couldn't use it. The product is fine used for frostings or icings though."
2603,Neutral,duplicate color,"I got these today, and though I cannot comment on their performance, I should note that instead of getting a bottle of black which was supposed to be in the set, I got two bottles of brown. Brown is a color I rarely use so this is quite disappointing."
2604,Neutral,What's the Catch?,This food coloring kit sounds great except that they do not give the ounce sizes of the bottles.  What's up with that?  It would be nice to know how much product you are getting for your dollar.
2605,Neutral,Only O.K.,"Frankly, the flavor is nothing special.  There is no overtone of any Kahlua influence.  Dom Francisco vanilla nut, and hazelnut are just as good, if not better, at half the price."
2606,Neutral,Good coffee but flavor was barely noticeable,"Given all the 5-star reviews and feedback, I was expecting a strong hazelnut flavor.  However, the hazelnut flavor was barely noticeable to me, although I was generous with the ground. Nevertheless, there was a hint of non-alcoholic Kahlua to it and the coffee tasted smooth."
2607,Neutral,"Good for baking, otherwise lumpy","The powder is really fine, so it mixes into baking nicely.  I use it with regular milk in pumpkin pie (instead of condensed milk) and the pie is just as tasty.  But, when trying to mix it into liquid to drink I couldn't get it smooth, even when I used a whisk.  I put it through a fine sieve (which is more work than justified) and even that didn't entirely smooth it out.<br /><br />Good for baking as a dry ingredient, not so much for drinking."
2608,Neutral,No ingredients listed - very high sugar %,"There was no ingredients listed for this product so I purchased anyway thinking all Instant Milk is basically the same, wrong: This stuff was hard to mix and must have been 25% sugar. I ended up giving all 4 pounds I purchased away, seller would never respond to my request of an ingredients list."
2609,Neutral,Diet Mt. Dew - if you want diet go elsewhere.,"Mt. Dew is a fabulous beverage. A fine morning pick-me-up, or a way to stretch the day.  A diet beverage, however, it is not.  Stick w/ the real thing.  The taste is reminiscent of regular Mt. Dew, but it's a tease."
2610,Neutral,Winterfrost flavor is better,"We love Eclipse mints, but the Spearmint flavor is too spicy for my family (tastes more like a peppermint).  We prefer the Winterfrost- it's minty but milder than the Spearmint."
2611,Neutral,"Expensive, but it worked!","I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all."
2612,Neutral,Meh,"I bought this for my cat, who suddenly started vomiting on a daily basis. No rhyme or reason for it either, not hairballs, or some kind of illness. This didn't help the vomiting issue and considering the cost of the food and composition, I've since switched her to a product richer in proteins that costs a similar amount and actually seems to have quickly cleared up the problem."
2613,Neutral,Way more expensive per pound than the larger-sized bags of the same food,"I posted my review for the quality of this cat food here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MWBFXY"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach Dry Cat Food - 15.5-Pound Bag</a>, which is the same food as this but in a larger bag.  Here, I just wanted to point out that this smaller size bag is actually much more expensive.  As of the date I'm writing this, this 3.5-pound bag costs $3.71 per pound, whereas the 7-pound bag costs $3.50 per pound and the 15.5-pound bag costs $2.32 per pound.  So you pay over 50% more per pound for this size compared with the largest size.  Just wanted to point this out in case it could save anyone money!  I like the cat food a lot."
2614,Neutral,Too large for cats,"This food may be good for my cats, but two of my ragdolls, and these are large cats, will not eat the chunks because they are so large."
2615,Neutral,Not tastey,"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try."
2616,Neutral,Item shipped smaller than what is pictured,"These are genuine Kasugai wasabi peas which are quite good, but the packages they shipped me are 3.06 oz instead of the 4.23 oz package pictured (or the 4 oz. shipping weight mentioned in the description).<br /><br />Keep this in mind if you are trying to shop on price."
2617,Neutral,Caramel,"I had never seen or heard of this cheese before when I saw it in the cheese section of my local supermarket, so I bought one out of curiosity. It's almost uncanny how caramel-like it is. It looks like an oversized version of a caramel candy you get at a store. It's brown-ish in color (like caramel). It's not a very hard cheese or very soft. It slices very easily. The taste is sweetly reminiscent of caramel. Maybe it would pair well with chocolate.<br /><br />It's so much like caramel that it is very unlike any other cheese I've tasted. That's the reason I only give it three stars - maybe it's technically a cheese, but it doesn't taste like cheese. That said, it's not bad, it's just unexpected."
2618,Neutral,Not real wasabi..,"Beacuase of its crunchiness, you can't get enough. Unfortuneately its made from horseradish and food coloring. True wasabi almost tatses like spicy pungent mint. I still like the crunch it packs and enjoy my sinuses being drained out."
2619,Neutral,Mixed feelings,"Okay, first, I love GoPicnic stuff in general. This was my first GoPicnic item, and I really enjoyed having it on whatever plane flight I brought it for. The crackers and hummus are absolutely *delicious*, and I practically licked the hummus tube clean. I could've eaten a half-dozen servings of those chips & hummus, in fact.<br /><br />But there's a few downsides, and they really got in the way of my love for this particular gopicnic.<br /><br />First, the hummus tube sometimes opens easily -- but sometimes it's like trying to open an over-glued box of milk when you're a little kid. You keep making dents, but you can't get at what you're after. Or, if you do, you end up somehow making holes in multiple spots and it oozes out of each. The tube could really use some kind of redesign. Both to make it easier to open, *and* to make it easier to get everything out once you *do* pry it open. I'm sure if you're eating it at lunch at your desk you've got scissors and can make short work of the task, but flying in coach you face a far more daunting task.<br /><br />Then, my second beef: The nut/fruit mix. This is, obviously, just a personal taste issue. I'm sure someone, somewhere, likes the mix. Me, I'd rather eat fruitcake. Or collard greens. (As you can probably guess, I don't care for either of those, either.) If I open the fruit/nut mix at all, it's to pick through and find a few bits I like. But that's a waste, and usually a bit disappointing. The desert, a dark chocolate square, is great for you pious lovers of the mystical chocolate -- but, me, I'm a wuss and like my chocolate like I like my women. Milky? Okay, that makes no sense. But I definitely prefer a lighter, milkier chocolate. Oh, and I almost forgot the dried edamame -- another dud for me. Which is weird, because I adore fresh edamame.<br /><br />Do I eat the dried edamame? Or the chocolate square? Or the fruit/nut mix? Yeah, usually I'd eat at least some of it, feeling kind of silly for just eating crackers and hummus when I paid for the whole box. I often peer around at whoever I'm traveling with, hoping/wishing I can get one of them to give the food a whirl so I don't feel like such an uncouth waster of perfectly good food.<br /><br />I'm trying not to vote this too low due to the food choices, because that's a personal taste thing, and I'm sure the components are well-executed. My low score is for the logistical difficulty involved. The best part of the whole meal is the hummus, but I can't *get* to it. And even when I do get to it, I can seldom get it all -- in both cases, this makes me a sad monkey. I hope my three stars aren't unfair. And I hope someday GoPicnic can tweak the packaging, or the lineup, or *something*. I really like the way they do things, so I'd *love* to love this. I just can't, not right now."
2620,Neutral,PRODUCT OF CHINA?,"While I like the meals in general, this one had a nasty surprise. The package of edamame is PRODUCT OF CHINA.<br /><br />Knowing China's food safety standards or total lack thereof, who would want to put that in their mouth? Bad show. Pick another supplier, GoPicnic!"
2621,Neutral,"Bland, bland, bland","There are so many hummus flavors out there that upon trying this and finding it bland with a sour aftertaste I was disappointed.  The crackers are the same multi-grain in several other gopicnics and are good but the roasted endamame...um...bland.  Dray and bland and sawdusty even.  Maybe if the main meal (hummus) had been flavorful these would have been a good side. No.  There are many flavors of endamame also on the market, why combine bland hummus with bland endamame??  I felt like I was eating a cardboard box.  The nut mix is good...it's also in the turkey sticks meal but the dark chocolate was a disappointment.  Mostly because it wasn't a more exciting dessert to reward you after eating a cardboard box for a meal.  Not even remotely interested in repurchasing."
2622,Neutral,wish there was more of that nut mixture...,"i bought this to have a handy gluten free snack - LOVED the nut/fruit mixture - wish i could buy it in bulk, i love crunchmaster crackers.. the hummus was ok  tasting, chocolate fine . i really didn't like the edamame .. it had a funny aftertaste .. i would buy again to have on hand - would prefer twice the amt of fruit/ nut mixture and no edamame! .."
2623,Neutral,Dark Chocolate spoiled in all 6 packages.,"Dark chocolate spoiled in all 6 packages.  Everything else was great. Also, had the same spoiled chocolate dessert in the Salami and cheese product."
2624,Neutral,Good GF/CF idea -- FOR ADULTS!,"I'm a GF/CF mom, and I was looking for something: #1 to bring with me when I to go work, #2 to send with my daughter for lunches, and #3 to bring for the family when we go on a ""field trip"" like to the museum or the pool.<br /><br />#1: GREAT choice! I LOVE the hummus, crackers, and fruit/nuts. The soybeans are ok. I give the chocolate to my husband or a friend. (I'm trying to avoid sugar.) I like that the meal is high in protein (25g!!) and fiber (12g!!). The individual packages make it easy to adjust to the size of my hunger: have one thing now; eat another later. Also, it's great to have a quick GF/CF option for times when I know I won't have a fridge or a stove.<br /><br />#2: Bad choice! These are not for children--even an adventurous one like mine! For example, the fruit and nut mix is called ""Baja Blend"", and it contains ""Habanero Almonds"" and . Few children will be able to handle this level of spiciness. My daughter LOVE edamame so I thought she'd go for them roasted, but these are very strong. Even the chocolate is a very bitter, dark chocolate. It's just not kid-food.<br /><br />#3 Ok choice. Divided amongst our family we can easily find someone to take each item from this box, and the fact that each item is individually wrapped makes it nice for the snack-style eating we do on a field trip, but they're really just too expensive to be used in this way. We're better off just packing the items that we want."
2625,Neutral,Good concept,"This was a good idea. Unfortunately, the main ingredient, the hummus - is what put it in the fail category for me. Aside from the chocolate, which seemed old to me, the other components were tasty enough. The hummus was not right as far as I was concerned. It came in a tube kind of like toothpaste and even if you could get past that, the taste was not like any hummus I have ever enjoyed. I realized that it was risky, as it is hard to beat delicious fresh hummus, but I was just hoping."
2626,Neutral,A good portable gluten free lunch option,"Overall, this product is a great idea. Portable, doesn't need to be refrigerated, low calorie, gluten free. However...this is the worst tasting hummus I have ever had in my entire life. The chocolate was crushed and resembled taffy. The trail mix is good, as are the crackers, especially considering they're gluten free. I purchased this six pack for around $18. At the current price ($29), I don't think I would purchase these at around $5 a piece - just get together some gluten free snacks and put them together in your own lunch kit."
2627,Neutral,"Good tasting, but not a good value.","Let me be clear, I thought the GoPicnic meals tasted good and were incredibly filling for the small amount of food in the kit. This is not to mention that the food provided is relatively healthy.<br /><br />My complaint comes in with the sheer cost of these meals. At around $4.16 per meal, this only becomes a good value only to those eating either very high-end foods or going out to eat for lunch every day. If you already take your lunch to school or work, chances are that your existing lunch is cheaper than it would be through GoPicnic.<br /><br />While Amazon gives a 15% discount and a $1.00 coupon, this still doesn't make it too much better. You're almost certainly better off buying hummus and crackers in bulk and portioning it out into lunches than by going this route. If you'd rather have convenience and don't mind paying a premium for it, then GoPicnic may be for you."
2628,Neutral,"Not strong at all, do not use by itself","The seasoning is terrible. You can doctor it however, but do not, I repeat, do not use it by itself. It seriously tastes like dried grass. I'm sure if you use it in a vinaigrette, or some other concoction it'd add a nice element. Alone, is tastes like crap."
2629,Neutral,ALLERGEN WARNING,"The label contains an allergen statement that this product was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, eggs and wheat.<br /><br />It would be very nice if the product description here would include this sort of very important information.<br /><br />This is the second Taste Specialty spice/herbal product that I've purchased has this same warning. The first was crystalized ginger, which would have been processed in a whole different manner, and presumably on different equipment. The warning is for ""equipment"" and not ""facilities.""<br /><br />I'm starting to think that it's a catch-all liability disclaimer put on all products, given that it names every allergen that has to be labeled -- which is not very helpful to those of us who rely on allergen statements."
2630,Neutral,3.5 stars for a good idea that costs too much,"I love Splenda and have been using it since it first debuted on the market.  Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it has no aspartame (which I am allergic too).  It also dissolves easily in hot and cold drinks.  For the last 6 months, I've been counting calories to lose weight and control my portions better.  When I saw the new enriched Splenda, I decided to give it a try because I had a coupon.  I drink a lot of hot tea to help curb my snack cravings, and I thought the added fiber might make a cup feel more filling.  While I'm not sure if it is more filling, I have noticed that the Splenda with fiber is sweeter to me.  I used to use 2 packets of Splenda in my tea, but only need one of these.  I'm not sure if this is because each packet has more in it, or if the fiber enhances the sweetness. Otherwise, it tastes the same as regular Splenda.<br /><br />However, this product also has some disadvantages that will keep me from buying it regularly.  First, as another reviewer noted, the packets are not simple paper.  They are foil-lined to keep the fiber from hardening the Splenda.  While I understand the necessity, it is inconvenient.  I often spill a little trying to open them because I can't shake the granules to the bottom first.  Second, it does not dissolve as easily, especially in cold liquids.  It will dissolve, you just need to add it more slowly and stir a lot.  Finally, and most critically, Splenda essentials are a LOT more expensive.  A 400 count box of regular Splenda is $11 on Amazon Subscribe & Save as of this writing.  In contrast, the Splenda Essentials with B vitamin or Antioxidants (the fiber is not yet available) are almost $15 for 320 packets.  I found a similar price differential in my local grocery store and at Wal Mart.<br /><br />Overall, if these were the same price as regular Splenda, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. As it is, I won't buy them again unless I have a coupon that makes it worth while. It's a good idea; especially to add vitamins to your diet in something you already use regularly.  But, it's not worth the price hike."
2631,Neutral,Great cookies but check the expiry date!,Bought the 3oz double chocolate chip cookies and liked them so much that also subscribed to these raisin oatmeal mini cookies. (the 3oz one was a big too big for me) 48 cookies arrived and as I checked the expiry date (or best before date) I realized I only had about 2 weeks to finish the 48 cookies. Great cookies and great deal if freshness can be guaranteed!
2632,Neutral,room for improvement,"good taste, but it needs more protein.  nice that's it's all natural though, nice snack...  those deep chocolate ones, though, i think they are worth it!"
2633,Neutral,only so-so,"It seems to have more carrots than other brands and also seems to have more ""juice to veggie"" ratio than other brands."
2634,Neutral,Pretty good! But..,"You get tired of it fairly easily. I thought having a pack of 6 would prevent me from buying any more mints, but I couldn't even finish it. It got too tangy!"
2635,Neutral,Ok but not my style,"This product was very oily as the other reviewer said. It also had a strong roasted chipotle type flavor and the cloves are very strong as well. It was not my style of basmati.  If you love cloves and cinnamon and such than this will be a good product for you to try, but if you aren't into cloves then you should probably pass. I also didn't think the cloves flavor married with the roasted flavor.  It wasn't like the roasted flavor in the eggplant dishes I've had."
2636,Neutral,"meh, its okay...","My puppy eats these, but she doesn't seem to -love- them like other treats. The treats are kinda hard and my puppy makes a small mess on our floor with it but she eventually cleans most of it up.<br /><br />They do make her breath smell good, like Garlic."
2637,Neutral,Great dinner but horrible price!,My twins love this!! BUT Walmart sells them for $1/ for a 2pack!  Worth going there to save the extra $!
2638,Neutral,Good Snack!,"I would rather have real almond butter on a cracker, but this is good for travel or if u are on the run!"
2639,Neutral,Great chocolates.  Problems with shipping,"I bought these chocolates for my son's 1st birthday party and ordered them 3 weeks in advance hoping that they would arrive on time.  The seller called and assured me that they would arrive on time.  The package was sent in 2 separate boxes (one sent priority mail the other sent express mail.  Only one box arrived on time. I only had half of the amount of party favors for my son's party.  This was probably a mistake in shipping by the sender, but nonetheless a problem.<br /><br />The chocolates themselves are wonderful.  They taste great and look awesome.  If you decide to purchase this product, I would suggest you talk to the seller and make sure that the shipping is made on time to arrive for your event.  If you can get some sort of guarantee shipping date that would be great too."
2640,Neutral,Mrs. W,"I bought both the Chocolate coated and the Lemon Biscotti; while the lemon is quite tasty, I feel that the chocolate is not as sweet and is superior to the lemon in taste."
2641,Neutral,only rated well bc of price and low(er) sodium,"These are not flavorful snacks that will satisfy you if you have a craving for the crunchies.  If that is what you are looking for, try the Noi products (Tom Yum flavor is amazing).<br />These are bland and thin.<br />I give it props for the price."
2642,Neutral,Great product but almost twice the price,"My kid - and others - love these.  We can't buy enough of them.  Trader Joe's have occasionally been out of them<br />but has not been permanent. At our local one, they have been back in stock for quite a while now and we fortunately have<br />no trouble getting large quantities of them.  I was looking for some type of bulk deal but I admit my first reaction<br />to having found this was the same as the first reviewer...  why would I pay so much more? I suppose it's possible I<br />may change my tune later...  The product itself is great.  ""Good and good for you."""
2643,Neutral,Packaged goods--not so good.,"I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging."
2644,Neutral,"Good product, price not so hot","If you cannot find this on the grocery shelf, this is a good source.  At $1.38 per ounce, it's actually pricier than buying a box of 8 packets at my grocery store, where the price is $1.28 per ounce.  Weird."
2645,Neutral,Fat Free Cocoa,"The lowest calorie count that still has some flavor, although the flavor isn't much to write home about; we make it with fat-free milk which makes a good morning drink; frequently hard to find in grocery stores, thus ordering on-line is a necessity."
2646,Neutral,Disappointed,"When I ordered a large amount of these books to share with child care providers, I was greatly disappointed in what arrived for the amount I paid. I was expecting a larger book, not the 4x5 inch book that was delivered.  It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine."
2647,Neutral,This book is much too small,"It was a great price, but I can't read it to my class. It is like a little travel brochure."
2648,Neutral,Size does matter,"This book was purchased to be used in a classroom setting for read-a-loud purposes.  The small size of the book(4X6)makes that almost impossible.  The book itself is very cute and flows nicely, but is best shared with only one child at a time."
2649,Neutral,"Way overpriced online due to shipping charges, but otherwise great product","I love Innova EVO pet food and so do my two cats. Very healthy, great quality food and I was glad to see that Innova EVO's dry cat food line have expanded on their formulas (more variety: e.g. chicken, fish, etc.). My only gripe was that the shipping made this a much more expensive item than if I had purchased it directly from my local downtown pet store!"
2650,Neutral,added cost,"The Bonsai tree is a Bonsai tree.  That is about the only positive we can report.  It did not arrive in a timely manner. The additional cost for shipping and handling almost doubled the price.  The container is just a container nothing impressive.  It, however, the product ordered just not impressive.  A local garden outlet would be a better source for this product."
2651,Neutral,Disappointed in Pistachios,"Ordered these for my grandson's birthday, he was excited when he opened them and so we passed them around - didn't taste as fresh as I thought they should have, kind of embarrasing in front of friends and relatives - will not purchase these again - will buy them in the store and hope for the best."
2652,Neutral,Not very richly flavored,This milk is OK... I buy their 2% white milk which is amazing so I decided to try the flavored milk. I was expecting something rich and creamy unfortunately this was not that.
2653,Neutral,Thinner and not as strong as I expected,These are not bully sticks. They are much thinner and lighter. Our dog ate them very fast and it didn't take much chewing. At least they don't smell bad like some brands of bully sticks. What you pay is what you get...
2654,Neutral,beefy sticks- not good for tough chewers,"My dog loved these, but chewed them up in what seemed like seconds. They are not hard enough for tough chewers. I would recommend these for small dogs and dogs that aren't hard chewers."
2655,Neutral,"These are not bully sticks, nor do they last long","The other reviews are correct that say these ""beefy sticks"" aren't to be confused with ""bully sticks"".  While this Smokehouse product has similar pricing to bully sticks, they simply aren't bully sticks.  They aren't long lasting at all.  Because of the high price of these beefy sticks and they're more of a quickly consumed treat rather than a long lasting chew, I took 2 stars off the rating.<br /><br />My 30 lbs sheltie girl ate hers in less than 3 minutes and she's a lady-like eater, not a gulper.  But both shelties of mine do enjoy these beefy sticks greatly, so it gets 3 stars for what it is, a treat or a very quick chew.  I just won't buy them again.  True bully sticks are the way to go if you want something that will occupy your furry chewer's time.  A really thick bully (I buy the full 36"" bully canes, otherwise known as ""walking sticks"") will take my kids nearly 2 hours of steady chewing to get a few inches off of it.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a quick chew that's rather expensive, these Smokehouse beefy sticks are just that."
2656,Neutral,Thin,"I didn't realize these bones were so thin. I had assumed they were chew bones, but instead were actually a treat. If you are looking for something to occupy your dog for an hour, these aren't it. My 11 week old puppy chainsawed through one in no time. I really needed something to keep him chewing for a while, something that wasn't my couch or shoes. I'll keep looking..."
2657,Neutral,My dog loves them!!,my cavalier king charles has loved these since he was 3 months old and he is 1 yr and 2 months now. But they are so expensive!!! They are cheaper on wal mart 6.81 for 6.
2658,Neutral,Not as strong as regular bully sticks,I bought these for my pitbull puppy since he feels the need to chew everything in sight. These are not as thick/strong as regular bully sticks so he can go through one in about 5 minutes. On the plus side they dont smell awful so I guess its kind of a trade off. Not bad for the price.
2659,Neutral,Eh... I'll pass,"If you just really have to have an ESE machine and want good espresso you can't go wrong will illy.  But if you don't care about having a true espresso machine with a yucky portafilter that you have to keep clean then you should just go for the iPerespresso pods and machine instead.  I have compared these literally side-by-side and the complexity, intensity, and body of the iPerespresso shot just totally blows away the ESE shot, not to mention there is ZERO cleanup, but you are stuck with the pier pods, but who cares.  for 10 cents more a cup you get a truly perfect shot every single time of great illy espresso."
2660,Neutral,Small,"I paid $5.46 for this and bc of this am happy with the purchase. It's quality and tasty product but the 12 boxes definitely are smaller than I normally buy at the store. Good deal, for that price, but I wouldn't purchase again."
2661,Neutral,Note: Rating both coffee and seller,"This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it."
2662,Neutral,Just OK,"A little disappointed.  The ravioli taste OK, but too few of them.  Product has a lot of liquid; and although it has a pretty good flavor, there is a lot more of it than is needed for the amount of pasta.  Best if combined with vegetable to absorb all the excess sauce.  I use sweet potato, mashed."
2663,Neutral,Not bad...,"Most of these meals have too much salt. This one could use just a bit more salt, and a bit less spice.<br /><br />The trick with this one is to let it sit a bit out of the microwave so the heat spreads more evenly, or you'll burn your mouth on the hot spots.<br /><br />This is a decent dish. Add a little salt and some grated cheese and it's even better."
2664,Neutral,It's definitely NOT a Starbucks or CoffeeBean Chai Tea Latte!,"I am a BIG fan of Starbucks and CoffeeBean's Chai Tea Latte.  And was so excited to buy this product hoping that it would replace my $4 habit.  But I was dissapointed.  Another reviewer that gave it a good rating stated that ""it smells wonderful...tasting like a liquid pumpkin pie...Sweet, creamy and somewhat spicy"".  Well, it is sweet and creamy but not spicy like my favorite Chai Tea Latte.  It just doesn't even come close to that taste...but I have convinced myself that even though I'm giving up on the taste, I'm saving at least $3 per cup if not more.  And, yes, you can taste the splenda...and I can say that because I am a splenda fan.  Overall, I only gave it a three star because it's not a bad tasting item, but just not what I expected it to taste.  Maybe the wonderful aroma alone could satisfy you..."
2665,Neutral,I was a fan but now? Not so much...,"I used to love drinking this chai tea. I thought it was a good blend of sweet and spice to create the great chai taste. However lately when I have drank it, it tastes too artificial to me. Perhaps its the Splenda in it which once warmed up makes it taste this way. I'm not too sure but the fact it uses Splenda now is a big turn-off to begin with.<br /><br />I wish the taste had never changed since I was a loyal drinker of it. Now? Not so much and not at this price!"
2666,Neutral,Fairly Decent Flavor,"If you don't send water through the same tea disc a 2nd time, and don't add sugar, you will taste too much nutmeg over a cheap assam or green tea (which tastes like dirt). I also squirted some light whip cream in it and over it. After trying the undrinkable Gevalia cappaccino, I was relieved to find something I liked. The creamer isn't bad in this one. I don't know if it's a different kind or if it is a good combination of seasoning. I gave it 3 stars because for this price, Twinings should have used a better grade of tea. It tastes pretty good now, but there is still that lingering aftertaste of earthy tea. With the milk, it fills my insulated glass 3/4 of the way full. One other feature, it smells wonderful brewing! It IS Thanksgiving in a cup (thermal glass, I mean.) As a price comparison, using the 20% coupon at Bed, Bath, & Beyond, who sells it for $10.99, regularly, for the 16 disc (8 servings) pkg. and with their free standard shipping, it comes to $1.09 per serving before tax."
2667,Neutral,Splenda? My boyfriend loves it anyway.,"Whoah.  I had NO IDEA there was Splenda in this!  Maybe that's why I don't particularly care for it.<br />I mean, it's good, and drinkable, but... not my cup of tea... (you see what I did there??)<br /><br />The initial smell is awesome, but I do prefer the Wawa or Strabucks Chai Tea..<br /><br />However, my boyfriend LOVES this stuff.  He drinks it in a huge cafe mug, 2 (well 4 counting all that cream) discs at a time!  And then thinks about going back for more!<br /><br />Hey, Tassimo sells Starbucks products, maybe they will eventually get a Starbuck's Chai Tea Disc set for us to enjoy!?"
2668,Neutral,O-Ring Failure!!  Great taste but tea leaves don't stay in the disc,"I've purchased this product several time before, and never had this problem.<br />I currently am working on my first batch of a 2 pack shipment, so I'm hoping this problem doesn't continue.<br />The first 3 discs were ok, but the last 2 cups have had the tea leaves come out of the disc and into my cup.<br />The first time it happened I figured it out by getting a mouthful of them.  The second time, I watched the machine closely, and examined the disc afterward.  Seems like there is a production problem with the discs.<br />The disc gets very bloated, and the inside seal that keeps the contents inside, seems to fail.<br />I made some regular coffee immediately afterward, and didn't have any grounds seep out, so I think the problem is unique to these discs.  These are too expensive to have this happen even on one or two.<br />The product tastes WONDERFUL, but this problem is too serious too risk continued purchase of these."
2669,Neutral,Good tea but disappointed,"I read all the other reviews and have not seen anybody else experiencing the problem that I am having.<br /><br />Overall the tea is very good, but sometimes when I make it, the crushed up tea leaves end up in my cup.  I don't have this problem with any of the other products and the machine is always cleaned after every use.<br /><br />So I would not buy this product again, because of the problem I am having with it."
2670,Neutral,Hot Very Hot,"I love Demetris regular and extra horseradsih, but the Chipotle is really hot. I like hot food, wings etc but this was just too hot alone.  Now I use the extra horseradish mix and put a dash of this in too kick it up. But be warned, this is really hot"
2671,Neutral,"Astringent aftertaste, no foil or paper packaging","I really enjoy Ahmad English tea #1, so I tried thier Earl Grey. It has an astringent aftertaste, is too strong, and this particular box has no individual packaging to seal the flavor in. I prefer not to use foil wrapped products for environmental reasons but these packets need to be in an airtight container so as not to loose thier flavor. I really cannot taste much bergamot which is what I enjoy about an Earl Grey. Also, it smells too perfumey for me. I'll stick to Twinings Earl Grey."
2672,Neutral,okey,"Healthier it seems from regular Jell-o and that is always good. 3 Stars because I found it to be more pricey than others and the flavor was fine but did not in the end made a whole lot of difference. Jello is jello is jello and basically there are no surprises. Valued the lack of coloring and unhealthy ingredients. So why do I rate them 3 Stars instead of 4 or more? Well, the company send me an email through amazon promising a little extra if I took the time to review them, which I always almost do anyhow, but since they offered I took them at their word. I know on my first review, prior to this one, I was more generous with the stars system but this time around I am cutting down in the enthusiasm and allocate 3.5. Nice Jello, apparently many swear to the grand taste and advantage of this one but it is so hard to get too excited about Jello."
2673,Neutral,disappointing,"Great price on this special. After having some of this coffee at a high end restarant in Sedona AZ I thought I would order some, It had a fair amount of bittetness which was not present in the  restaurant version  The brewer machine I use does better on starbuck's.  It is good but not as good as I expected or hoped for.  Still a great purchase price"
2674,Neutral,It'll Do,"I buy this vodka sauce when my store is out of the much more flavorful Bertolli Vodka Sauce. Wolfgang Puck's version of creamy vodka sauce is a more bland-tasting sauce that doesn't add much kick to pasta dishes. I find myself having to add my own touch (seasoning) to it. In a bind, this vodka sauce will do; I'm just a little curious as to why this sauce doesn't have any punch. It more or less tastes like spaghetti sauce. Is it really a creamy spaghetti sauce? Not to mention the price is higher than a lot of sauces out there. Avoid this sauce if you can."
2675,Neutral,Not the freshest product - chemical taste,"Compared with the black licorice Haribo, this product seemed not as soft and fresh.  Some pieces also seemed to have an unpleasant chemical taste to them.  It's hard to know whether this was just a stale package or if the formulation differences between the licorice flavor and strawberry flavor cause the significantly worse texture in the strawberry product, but if one really loves strawberry licorice, you can still manage to enjoy this product.  Overall, somewhat disappointing.  Not sure that I would buy this again."
2676,Neutral,Okay...,"The taste of these is great, but our bag was a little dry and chewy.  That said, the party kids ate them up without hesitation and loved unrolling them.  Might consider buying them again, but we've had our fill for a while."
2677,Neutral,BEWARE-VERY SLIMY,The strawberry licorice wheels are pretty good.  My biggest complaint is the slime.  You don't think you ought to have to wash your hands after having licorice but with these you do.  They have a pretty good flavor and tend to be addicting (what candy isn't).  Just know what you are getting into because 5 lbs is a lot of candy.
2678,Neutral,"Not great, but not bad either.","These candies were not bad and I will probably buy again, but I was disappointed.  They are very chewy (almost tough) and just taste like an inexpensive candy.  Ironically, in the same order, I also purchased the black licorice wheels (also by Haribo) packaged in the smaller bags.  In contrast, the black licorice wheels were very fresh, moist and tasty.  I think whether or not a person likes the red wheels simply depends upon their individual taste.  If the red ones presented like the black ones (moist, fresh and very tasty), I would be very pleased.  Perhaps it would be helpful to describe the red ones as an ""ordinary"" and the black ones as ""gormet."""
2679,Neutral,Smaller than I thought,These were purchased as favors/part of centerpiece but I expected them to be much larger.  Make sure you take a look at a ruler before you order.
2680,Neutral,Good meal - If you spiff it up,"I confess. I am not a vegetarian. However I purchased these to consider bringing on a trip as a self-contained meal.<br /><br />First of all - This comes in a can just bit bigger than a tuna can, with a peel-off cover. It includes salt, pepper, and a spork. The meal says it has ""2 servings."" However, in most cases (unless you are sharing with a friend) you will eat both servings yourself.<br /><br />For the entire can, the food values are:<br />Fat 10g<br />Sodium 720 mg<br />Carbs 52g (Fiber 14g - Sugars 4g)<br />Protein 10g<br />Total Calories 340<br /><br />I tried this first as an ""on the go"" meal taking just a few bites out of the room-temperature can. I wasn't thrilled.<br /><br />So I emptied the can into a bowl and added an ounce of shredded cheese and a small piece of leftover chicken breast (cut up). I ate it with a small pack of Cheez-its and really did enjoy it as a meal.<br /><br />While I don't recommend this as an ""eat out of the can meal,"" I do think it has possibilities as a side dish. So, 3 stars."
2681,Neutral,Okay,This product is just okay.  I think it needs more garlic.  I love strong garlic taste and this one had a mild taste.
2682,Neutral,Good but with caveats,"Your satisfaction with this product will depend on how you eat it. This is not the kind of cereal you pour into a bowl, add milk and eat immediately. Unfortunately, the cereal is very hard; I would not call it crunchy, it's just plain hard.<br /><br />There are two ways around this. I customarily pour this cereal on top of plain yogurt, add milk and let it sit in the fridge overnight. By morning, the cereal is soft but not soggy. Of course it's not crunchy/crispy either but when you eat gluten-free you tolerate a lot. Alternatively, you can add milk or water to the cereal and heat it in the microwave. It's actually good this way, like a form of oatmeal.<br /><br />I don't mind the flavor, but again, I've been eating gluten-free for 3 years and know not to expect too much. I do like the fact that a serving provides 5 grams of fiber (more challenging to get on a gluten-free diet) and is fortified with vitamins and minerals."
2683,Neutral,Mixed reaction,"Pluses - 1) it does contain the organic ingredients I was looking for, and 2) it's gentle on the stomach.<br />Minuses - 1) the taste isn't great. I had to use honey, which I prefer not to do. 2) the loose leaf ingredient particles are tiny, so they're small enough to leak out of my infuser. Cheesecloth baggie works much better."
2684,Neutral,very hard,"These will be great for my daughter when she's over a year old or so, but at 11 months, she is not quite ready for something this large and crunchy.  They don't dissolve easily like the Gerber lil crunchies or puffs and I had to dig a whole wagon wheel out of her mouth so she wouldn't choke because she put the whole thing in there and it just sat there without dissolving, even using her teeth and gums to try to mash them.  They are about the size of a quarter so I tried cutting them up into cheerio size pieces but they still just sit on her tongue and don't dissolve and she has a hard time swallowing even the smaller pieces.  I bought a bunch in bulk so I will save them for when she's a little older.  I just wanted other parents to be careful what ages these wagon wheels are fed to."
2685,Neutral,Great product but I don't like the packaging,I love these and my 8 month old loves them but I don't think the product canister does a good job of keeping them fresh.  It seems like they go stale VERY fast.  I don't think the baby cares but since I eat them with her it bothers me.
2686,Neutral,Some are too big!,"My son is now 9 months old, he has been eating finger foods for a few months now. We first purchased the Gerber Graduates Mild Cheddar & he loves them! They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!"
2687,Neutral,Not a complete discripton of product given,"I have never purchased tart cherries before. I was elated to find them on the Internet.  However, when I opened the package I discovered that the package contains not only tart cherries, but also sunflower oil, which I must avoid.  Had I known this from the discription, I would not have purchased them."
2688,Neutral,Average,Last time I ordered the same flowers and the bouquet was really good and lasted a while.<br /><br />This time the size was smaller and it lasted half the time.<br /><br />Not happy with the inconsistency.
2689,Neutral,Dry and Not as Appealing as other treats,"I love the idea of this dog treat, that it cleans teeth and freshens breath.  However, to get the maximum effect of that, the box suggests feeding him two bones a day every day for the cleanest teeth.  I normally don't treat my dog that often, because I don't think it's that good for him and also the cost of treats.  I'd have to buy a box a week to keep up with that!  But as to the taste of it, my dog was very unappealed by it.  He still ate them, as he is a dog afterall, but he would put it down and come back to it and work on it almost in the way he does actual dry bones.  I just think it lacks the taste and therefore his interest.  He much prefers tastier treats as he gobbles them up or spends his time gnawing on his bones. But I still give 3 stars as it does seem to help his teeth and breath!  Now if they could just make it more appetizing.  My guy is not, by far, a picky eater, so if he's pickin' there's a problem!"
2690,Neutral,so so,"these might be good for cleaning your dog's teeth, but so far I haven't been able to get my dogs to eat them - they just hide them.  Hopefully they will start eating them eventually."
2691,Neutral,Dogs liked it better than I did,"Hartz isn't the brand that comes to mind when I consider 'quality' dog treats, and I wasn't sure mine would eat them.  My ""small"" dog weighs in at 25 lbs, and these biscuits were just right for her.  Her big sister, at 65 lbs, did also have to chew them before swallowing. I also tried them on my boss's crew of 5 miscellaneous dogs, and they all ate them except the one who won't eat anything. I wouldn't put much faith in their effectiveness as teeth cleaners though.<br /><br />As a ""dog mom"", I was not impressed with the ingredients.  These biscuits had far too many ingredients that just didn't measure up as ""health encouraging"" to inspire much faith on my part.  I can find treats that are far healthier, and chews that are far better as tooth cleaners than these biscuits do either one.<br /><br />All in all, its a 3 star ho-hum product.  Nothing to get excited about, and I won't be excited enough to seek them out at the store either!"
2692,Neutral,"Better than green beans, not as good as kitty poop","My Boston Terrier eats these, but does not appear to enjoy them any more than Milkbones. They are very hard and crunchy, which should be good for cleaning their teeth as advertised.<br /><br />My ancient Pekingese mix (with a very small mouth, and snaggly, horrible teeth) either can not, or will not chew them. She just holds them in her mouth or sets them down. I broke one in half to see if the size was the problem, but she still did not eat it.<br /><br />I did not try these myself, but I'm going to say that my household consensus is that these are not a favorite."
2693,Neutral,"A bit large for a small mouth, but definitely enjoyed","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>What better way to review a dog biscuit than to show how much a dog enjoyed eating it? That was my logic behind this very amateurish but heartfelt video review starring my 1 1/2-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy.<br /><br />The video was very impromptu and, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't do a great job of explaining why I only gave the product 3 stars, so I'm adding some further explanation here.<br /><br />First, I took a star off because I felt that if you're going to make a multi-sized dog biscuit, the small should be small enough for the very small breeds like Yorkies and Chihuahuas.  As you can see in the video, this small biscuit is not only 2 inches long and quite thick but VERY hard, so I feel like a very small or more delicate breed may have trouble with even the small biscuit.<br /><br />Second, the ingredient list on the box is almost 3 inches long.  Sugar and salt are within the first 10 ingredients and, while there are a lot of vitamins and minerals included, there is also partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, several food colorings and chemicals I can hardly pronounce.  I just prefer to feed Missy more natural foods and snacks.<br /><br />Third, the ""feeding instructions"" (which hardly seemed necessary) direct me to give Missy 2 biscuits twice a day.  That's 4 large (compared to the small Mother Hubbard bone-shaped treats she usually gets) treats a day, which seemed a bit much, especially much considering my issues with the ingredient list."
2694,Neutral,the smalls not small enough for small dogs,"I guess when they did the taste test for these and stated preferred two to one sadly my dog (Chloe) was sitting in the other group. I have a 12 lbs. Papillon and give her the competitor bones and she loves those. I don't think it was the flavor as much as the size with these. For being `small' the bones are twice as large as the other ones. I think that was the issue for my `Chloe', she could not get her poor small mouth around it. She would try to suck it until it was ready to break. Even if I broke it, the pieces were too thick. I think if they were not so thick she would not have any issues. As far as the breath factor I did notice it improved in that area! That alone I would buy them but the size is what would deter me. I gave some to a bigger dog, a 55 lbs lab mix and he did not have a problem chewing them but still had to break the bone up. Over all I think it is a good idea but the size is not what I would consider small. Maybe a small treat for a bigger dog but too big for small dogs."
2695,Neutral,Hard to judge,"This is a very large dog cookie that has 170 calories -- roughly what my dog would get if I fed him a candy bar.  The package says that for maximum benefit I should feed two of these to my dog a day -- 340 empty calories.  While my dog eats these enthusiastically and wouldn't object, that won't be happening any time soon.  The downside of this product is obvious, while the benefit of its contribution to cleaner teeth is much harder to assess."
2696,Neutral,My dog wasn't big on these...,"I got these treats for my extra large Chihuahua who will eat anything.  She wasn't a fan of these.  Whenever we decide to give her a treat we ask her if she wants a ""snackee"" & she gets very excited.  She'll run in circle & stand on her hind legs.  When we gave her this for a ""snackee"" she just looked at it, smelled it & then looked to us like we were joking her.  We left it there & she looked at it again & smelled it & then chose to walk away from it.  This dog turns down nothing except for lettuce.  After it sat there for about 30 mins I put it in her dog dish & about 6 hours later she decided to get it out & contemplate eating it for about 10 more minutes before she decided to finally try it.  She did finally eat all of it but we know she wasn't big on it because the next couple times we gave her one it was the same routine, it sat for hours before being eaten.<br /><br />Her opinion is that she's not big on them & wouldn't recommend them but if given one she'll eventually eat it to make it go away."
2697,Neutral,Better than nothing,"These biscuits are probably better than nothing, and they did seem to clean some of the yellowish gunk off his teeth; after three of these over the span of a weekend, my dog's teeth were noticeably whiter, although spots of tartar and plaque remained in the remoter portions of his teeth.<br /><br />I generally prefer organic dog food with short, simple ingredient lists, and at first was a little concerned when I saw that the  list on these things was half the height of the box. However, spot checking the ingredients shows that most of them (Calcium Pantothenate or Pyridoxine Hydrochloride for example) were just vitamin supplements; a few were harder to decipher, though (Sodium Hexametaphosphate?)  The most common ingredient is wheat, so if your dog has a wheat allergy, avoid these.<br /><br />As to taste, I refrained from trying them myself, but it did seem a bit dryer and more powdery than other treats I feed him; he didn't seem as wildly enthusiastic about them as he is about his organic kibble, but he sure ate every speck, and started noticing when I got the box out. (To be fair, he'd probably eat bark if I put it in a bowl with some kibble and water).<br /><br />Overall, these are probably a good option if you want to do something for your dog's teeth; they're certainly far cheaper than the other dog dental treats I've seen for sale. I don't think they're going to be an adequate substitute for getting your dog's teeth cleaned at the vet, though."
2698,Neutral,Dogs love them! But certainly not a dental supplement.,"I have 2 dogs, a sheltie mix and long haired chiauaua, I will say that the ""LARGE"" size biscuits were way to big for both of my dogs so I broke the large biscuit in half and gave each dog a piece of it. The dogs loved them! In fact I went to my front door to get the box and normally my dogs don't get excited about boxes. But this time I guess they could smell the treats inside because they both went crazy! I'll say that the box is bigger then I expected, contains approx 16 biscuits. The ""serving size"" on the box I'm not sure about as it says ""for best results give 2 twice a day. If my math is right they want you to feed your dog a total of 4 of these a day and at that rate the box will last 3 and a half days.  If the treats were healthier and not so much filler I wouldn't see a problem with this IF it really helps the teeth, but with it being mostly filler I couldn't see feeding my dogs 4 of these every day. They are a good treat every now and then, but certainly not to be used as an on-going dental treatment because you would go through 2 boxes a week and at the current price it would be about $48 a month and that is just for 1 dog. These in my opinion are purely TREATS and not dental supplements. I will be submitting a picture of my dogs with these treats if you would like to see how excited they were when I got them out! I rated these at 3 out of 5 simply because of the healthiness of these compared to the ""recommended serving."" As far as my dogs go, I think they would give it a 5."
2699,Neutral,Cheap and easy clean,"Reviewing dog biscuits is a little difficult. Did my golden retriever eat the biscuits? Yes, quite readily.  Did her teeth and breath get noticeably cleaner? Perhaps, but having only tried one box--which lasted a couple of weeks--I am not sure I can guarantee such a result.  Like all dog treats, they seem to recommend a lot per day."
2700,Neutral,A nice sized snack,"I have two Shih-Tzu/Pomeranian mix dogs that can be a bit finicky when it comes to what they eat. It did take them a while to warm up to these, but now they seem to love them. One of them will eat every crumb, then go check to see if his brother left any crumbs. Though I don't think these will ever replace my dogs' favorite ""Greenies,"" these are a good change of pace for them."
2701,Neutral,3 out of 5 won't eat!!,"I love the idea of a dog biscuit that will freshen your doglies breath.  I have 5, so I'm always trying different dental bones and things to help me out there.  These bones are the perfect size, smell great~~like human food, actually~~but out of 5 dogs, only 2 would eat them.  I actually put one in my youngest dog, Tobey's mouth, and tried to coax him.  He spit it back out!!  Not sure if it was the smell, or the taste, but I hate to report that it would be a waste of money for me to buy these.  I have 4 Lhasa Apsos, and a Schneagle~~the Lhasa's I do have to say are pretty picky eaters, and 3 of them are the ones who wouldn't touch them, so take that as you will.<br />I WISH they loved them so that they COULD Crunch n' Clean!!"
2702,Neutral,Dogs give them 5 stars... their dentist not so much,"These biscuits are advertised to ""clean"" your dogs teeth.  My dogs were very happy and willing participants in the experiment.  They loved the biscuits (but frankly... if it comes from a human hand, they will gulp it down even if it were garbage... they're dogs... that's how they're wired).<br /><br />However, after using these, I couldn't really tell a difference in the cleanliness of my dogs teeth.<br /><br />If you want to give your dogs a treat, these will work great.  However, don't expect them to replace regular cleanings at your dogs at the vet.<br /><br />[NCJVR]"
2703,Neutral,Huge Dog Biscuits,"These biscuits are huge, almost a meal. We have 3 dogs, and they did eat them, although they were sort of luke warm in the process.  They did not bolt them down like they do with milkbone.  We only had the one box and I did not notice any difference in the way their teeth looked or their ""dog breath.""<br /><br />Because it is a vine product, I do not know if the price of the item is fair. I think I will just stick with Milkbone products."
2704,Neutral,"she likes it, but what the heck is DentaShield?","We received Hartz Crunch 'n Clean biscuits through the Vine program, and our medium-sized dog can go through a large-sized biscuit in about a minute.  She enjoys them, but I'm concerned about the patented ingredient, DentaShield.  ""Invented by researchers at Indiana University's School of Dentistry, the same researchers who developed flouride for you and me,"" DentaShield might be the sodium hexametaphosphate listed as the 5th ingredient after wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, and wheat germ meal.  It sounds like a salt, which isn't necessary to clean tartar from teeth, as the box claims.  Other ways are better to clean dogs' teeth.<br /><br />These biscuits are definitely loaded with non-essential ingredients like partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and artificial color (they're uniformly tan, so where's the color?).  The blurb about the same researchers who developed fluoride set off warning bells, as many people know the issues with mass amounts of fluoride in our drinking water, but people unfamiliar with those issues may feel this is a good advertising tactic.<br /><br />Our dog likes them, but dogs tend to like junk food, including human food.  So, if you're conscientious about what you feed your critters, consider buying locally-made biscuits or make them yourself from a recipe online."
2705,Neutral,My dog isn't crazy about them,Normally when I take out treats or bones for my dog she starts doing her tricks right away and whining in anticipation.  When I take this box out she doesnt even get up. When I hand her a bone she lets it drop to the floor and just sniffs it.  Sometimes she'll eventually eat it. Other times she just walks away from it.  I will update my review after she's been using them for a while to report back whether her teeth are any cleaner.  That's assuming I can get her to eat them.
2706,Neutral,My pups will eat anything--but they won't eat these unless they're the big ones,"I haven't had the same success as other reviewers here. My two sibling dogs are Rhodesian Ridgeback/Beagle mixes, and they are basically breathing vacuum cleaners. If it hits the floor, they eat it. I normally treat them to Stop & Shop brand treats in the assorted flavors (and colors) because they love them. The medium sized Hartz Crunch n Clean biscuits have been spit out repeatedly by my two 55 pound dogs. I even broke them in two to make them smaller for my dogs' mouths and they still reject them. It seems to be not only the size, but the fact that these biscuits are extremely hard. I'm sure that is what helps remove tartar, but my dogs only like a tough chewing job when they are enjoying a rawhide bone.<br /><br />On the other hand, the LARGE variety go over better, but not so much as quick treats but as if my dogs think I've just given them a rawhide to gnaw on. They're just in for a surprise when, after enough chewing of these hard bones, they actually break apart and become edible.<br /><br />Some of the main ingredients include wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, poultry fat, poultry digest, sugar, dried whey, malted barley flour, dried cane molasses, citric acid, corn starch, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Aside from also having vitamins in the ingredients, these treats are loaded with ingredients that are hard to pronounce and sound like things you learned bout back in chemistry class!"
2707,Neutral,My dog likes the other brand better.,"I gave a Hartz to my dog and he ate part of it and stopped. Then I gave him the ""other"" brand and he ate it up. So my dog only will eat this if there's nothing else around. It's hard to write a review since it's up to the dog whether he likes it or dislikes it. Each dog is different on what they feel is good so I didn't get to the point to see if it helped his teeth or not."
2708,Neutral,Mixed opionions from my two dogs.,"I have 2 medium sized dogs, a siberian husky who is a bit of a picky eater and my puli who is a trash can. They both are typically fed Wellness brand products, so I wasn't sure how they would like  the Crunch 'n Clean biscuits.<br />My puli, being the little trash can he is, stared at and played with a biscuit for a while before digging in, which is not his usual form. However, after a few minutes he snarfed it right up and he has continued to do so for the past several days.<br />My husky on the other hand initially left her biscuit and stared at it. Then she licked it and stared at me, leaving it on the ground and walking away.  I tried again the next day with similar results. On day three she begrudgingly took it and ate it, but she left bits of it all over the floor, which is not her MO for our normal brand.<br />I think, therefore, it is likely that how well your dog will or won't like these treats is dependent on how finicky your dog is.<br /><br />They do appear to assist with removal of food particles. I could not ascertain whether they assisted with tartar build-up removal as neither of my dogs really have this problem. However, if the loose food is removed, I suppose you could argue that it would reduce the potential for tartar build-up in the future. It did not make their breath smell remarkably different.<br /><br />The caloric content is high considering the ingredient list (50 cal/biscuit). This could be a problem for anyone with pets that have weight issues as the recommended serving is 2 biscuits twice a day for 200 calories total. The ingredient list also sports a number of grain products, wheat, barley flower,  and corn starch, which could be a problem if your pet has allergies. It also contains partially hydrogenated oils and sugars, neither of which are particularly good for either pets or people. So those people who worry about what their dogs eating, or those with pets with allergies will probably not find this product to their liking. I am most concerned with the calorie content and wonder if the reason I did not notice noticeably fresher breath was because I fed my dogs half the recommended serving (so 1 biscuit twice daily) as I have one pet whose weight I have to watch.<br /><br />All in all I think this is a split decision. I think many dogs will like the biscuits, like my puli and be just fine with them. They are a good size for the medium breeds and they probably will prevent future tartar build-up. For finicky eaters and/or owners, or those pets who have grain allergies, a different choice may make more sense."
2709,Neutral,Just okay,"Is it me, or does the description ""full leaf"" inspire the idea that the leaf is actually complete, or at least broken but sufficiently large? I was really looking forward to seeing actual rose leaves and full leaves, but instead the tea bags I got have leaves that are so small and broken, they are almost dust. Overall the tea is okay -- not great. Has a nice smell, but flavors far too fast and does not last through two steepings."
2710,Neutral,Not what I expected,"You have to be careful of how long, and at what temperature you prepare this tea. I would recommend 180F and not a second over 5 minutes. This tea has a tendency to become extremely bitter very quickly. Another note, most of the fruit pieces will settle to the bottom of the bag, so make sure you get a good mix of leaves and fruit before you steep. If done properly it can taste very good, but again the margin of error on this one is slim."
2711,Neutral,Sliced Hard Chicken Hot Dogs for Cats!,"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
2712,Neutral,"Poor quality ingredients, but my cat loves it.",I bought this product because my older cat stopped eating the wellness dry and wet food I usually fed her.  She likes this food and she begs for it every morning and evening when it is time for her meal.  The ingredients are not quality ingredients but this food is keeping my kitty satisfied.
2713,Neutral,Convenient but has it's issues,"I have found these to be convenient when on long road trips, or in small spaces such as a on a plane. However, while they are convenient bottles, they do not come with the nipple and so you will need to remember to bring that along. Also the bottle tends to leak. It may be because of the nipple I am using is not the recommended nipple. All in All, I do recommend them for on the go but they are not something I would recommend for everyday use."
2714,Neutral,They all taste very similar,"Fun to have such a selection of decaf teas, but they taste a lot alike.  I'll probably reorder the Spiced Rasberry, but not the collection."
2715,Neutral,Really Hard,"I bought this item because I loved it when I tried the candy before. However, the package I received was really hard, almost not chewable. I was fairly disappointed."
2716,Neutral,tasty flavors,"I love bars in a couple different flavors, including chocolate chip. Mostly because they do not contain high fructose syrup, and also because they provide a healthy in between meals snack."
2717,Neutral,chewy granola bars,"All of the bars are of course past the expiration date. It doesn't affect the taste, but makes the bars break apart easily."
2718,Neutral,disappointed and an unpleasant smell,well....let me state first that we like this natural sugar.  that said...when we received it...it must have come in contact with dampness either from the manufacturer or via shipping....each bag of sugar was hard.  we had to bang it on the counter many times to break it up.  have had it once before and it was fine.  wasn't hard or lumpy but still smelled weird!<br /><br />now for the unpleasant part....it does not smell like regular processed white sugar from supermarkets.  it has an odor of cat pee.  which i thought very peculiar.  although...when you use it to cook with or put it in tea..coffee...cereal...this odor disappears completely.  i guess it's the nature of the unrefined processing????<br /><br />it's actually stronger than 'white' sugar!  you don't need as much!  and we will buy it again.  just don't have a sensitive nose or keep your nose out of the sugar jar!  and you'll be just fine!
2719,Neutral,Ceylon Tea Bags Smaller Than Most,"Overall I'd say this is a good buy. However the tea bags are smaller than usual, so you will only make one small cup per bag, and that will be a mild brew at that.  The thing that bugs me about these tea bags is that they float in you cup. They don't seem to want to absorb the water."
2720,Neutral,OOLONG Tea,"I was not impressed with the flavor of this tea. It has a unique smell too. I try to drink it every now and then because it is suppose to be good for you. However, I prefer English breakfast tea."
2721,Neutral,Just OK,"I'm a big oolong/wulong tea drinker. Good price, but the taste of this tea is just ok. Not my favorite. My service from Amazon was great, as usual."
2722,Neutral,Hard Red Winter Wheat 1 lbs.,"Grain was bought for gift to use for sprounting last winter, I think it was a little pricy but was handy for needs."
2723,Neutral,Not as remembered-but still tastes good,"while the flavor is remains the same, i notice that the color of the crackers is different than when i first purchased these crackers from a local retailer back in 2006. Back the, the crackers had the same coloring as the image on the box.  they now apprear to be more reddish in coloring.  Also, there is a lot of breakage within the package.  the shipping container and the cracker boxes themselves are in good shape, but more broken crackers than expected."
2724,Neutral,"Not bad, not wonderful","This is a good product for those who want to relive the ""nostalgia"" of having eaten too much of the processed Spaghettio- type canned pasta as a kid.  I wouldn't want to get my kids hooked on the stuff though.  For those who are not a fan of the meatballs, I find that they are better when they break up in the sauce and you are just left with a crumbly, chewy texture overall.  That being said, this $2.50+ per can is a steep price to pay (plus, like I said, you don't rurally want to eat too often- it may be organic, but it's sure not health food).  Also, if you have the opportunity,  Whole Foods has numerous store brand versions of Annie's products.  They all seem pretty much the same to me, and they are a good deal cheaper."
2725,Neutral,"The pasta is really goood, but the ""meat""balls are really nasty!","I've been a vegetarian for 10 months. I have tried Annie's Bunny Grahams and enjoyed them! I've recently started trying faux meat. Target had the  P'sghetti With Soy Meatballs one sale for $0.99 per can. I picked up a can and was eager to relive my childhood chef boy-ar-dee days. I cut one of the ""meat""balls in half and ate it with a spoonful of pasta. My first thought was ""this tastes gross!"". I took another spoonful of pasta  with a tiny bit of the ""meat""ball, so little that the tomato sauce would covered the taste. I enjoyed it! I ate tiny bits of the soy meatballs until all of the pasta was gone. I hated throwing them away, but just couldn't stand the taste of Annie's mock meat. I will load up on the plain pasta varieties!"
2726,Neutral,Good but could be even better,"It seems hard to find great muesli these days. I think this is one of the better ones, and I do buy it. However, I wish those making muesli would heed the latest nutritional advice. For example, nutritionists say that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is important and that we generally get too much of the omega-6 fatty acids and not enough of the omega-3's. This muesli would be a lot more nutritious if it replaced the large amount of sunflower seeds (high in omega-6 fatty acids) with walnuts (high in omega-3 fatty acids) and almonds. And to me that would make it taste better too. I also wish they would make a version without all the raisins and dates, allowing one to add fresh fruit (e.g., raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc.) instead of dried fruit.<br /><br />I was in Australia last spring and found great muesli there not only meeting these nutritional criteria but tasting better than this or most other muesli. To me nuts are an important part of good muesli. But I'm being a bit of a purist, I know, and a friend tells me I'm a food snob, so take my opinion with that in mind!"
2727,Neutral,"Great, if you LOVE sunflower seeds!","I am impressed by the overall quality of the ingredients that go into this product.  Very healthy, and I prefer to eat it without soaking as recommended.  However, there are an overwhelming amount of sunflower seeds, so much that they overwhelm all the other great ingredients.  I know it is an inexpensive filler and prices are skyrocketing, but after a few days, it gets really boring to eat when it tastes like nothing but sunflower seeds, bite after bite."
2728,Neutral,Wasn't Quite what I was expecting,I was searching for muesli like I had eaten for breakfast almost everyday in London.  This wasn't quite the mix.  I think that flax seed tends to add a flavor that I don't like.  The cookie recipe on the package was pretty good.
2729,Neutral,So so,"I wanted to try something healthy and different.  I've had meusli in Europe. They put little chocolate flakes in theirs and it makes a big difference.  This stuff is not very exciting.  Very little flavor.  Not too sweet, which is good. I wish the oats were baked to make them crunchy.<br />But this is just me :-)<br /><br />Cheers."
2730,Neutral,Great taste ok price,"I have to say, as far as taste its a 5 stare.  Though i was expecting 1 lb of fireballs would be more then what it is."
2731,Neutral,"Fine, but others are better","It's better than average. But I agree that for the normal price ($10/12oz), you can get Intelligentsia or other really wonderful coffee. Regarding price, even the sale price/discount offers don't offer much better of a price than what you can do in the grocery store."
2732,Neutral,It's average.,"I found this coffee to be slightly better than the Eight O'Clock French Roast that I purchased on the same day.  Honestly though, it makes me wonder if the beans sold in these bags are the same beans used at Starbucks.<br /><br />The coffee seemed weak and astringent, and while certainly not without merit, it just doesn't seem to be worth the cost.  The 3-pack sold here averages out to almost $10 a bag -- for $10, you can get something from Atomic Cafe or the Roasterie that will have you jumping out of bed every morning in anticipation of that first cup of TRULY excellent coffee."
2733,Neutral,Decent (not-spicy) snack,"Maybe it's because I've never had brisket strip ""jerky"" before, or maybe it was just the batch that I got, but these seemed much greasier than the usual products of this type.  I had to tear bits of fat from each strip before I ate and I could still feel my mouth coated with grease as I chewed.<br /><br />And again, this may have been related to my particular batch, but calling these ""spicy"" is laughable as I wasn't able to get a even a hint of a kick from any of the three bags I ordered.  If I'd known that these were about as spicy as ketchup, I would not have ordered tham and will likely not order them again because I prefer my jerky to have at least a little heat.<br /><br />Those complaints aside, this stuff is very tender and has a good and strong BBQ flavor (spicy or no).  I've never eaten Stubb's BBQ, but if this is a reasonable approximation of what goes on in his restaurants, then I wouldn't hesitate in stopping and eating there.  I'd just bring my own Tabasco."
2734,Neutral,Pumpkin Spice.....much to be desired !!!,Pumpkin Spice was too weak in the spice flavors for me.  I brewed a second cup and used less water and it wasn't much better.  Will not buy it again.
2735,Neutral,Compared to Dunkin's,"I am a huge fan of Pumpkin Spice coffee, however, it just didn't come up to the depth and flavor of<br /><br />  Dunkin's.  Having said that I am, however, a big fan of Green Mountain coffee and drink it daily."
2736,Neutral,not as good as GJ,"I love pumpkin spice coffee, but this is not nearly as good as the Gloria Jean pumpkin spice flavor.  I wish GJ's pumpkin spice were available in K-cups."
2737,Neutral,Note: Rating both coffee and seller,"This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it."
2738,Neutral,For $14 a pound,"It's a good bargain for $14 dollars a pound! But it's just your regular old jerky. No taste or anything, just your regular meat--regular jerky, you just get more bang for your buck!"
2739,Neutral,not bad for the price,"its really no better than that crap jack links. a lot of the pieces are to tough to chew and i eat real jerky all the time. this is only slightly better than jacks link. the only pro is its cheap. ill take quality over this next time. half of it is just dog food because of its poor quality. its not real beef jerky, its very moist and tough. i like real dry jerky. i had to spit some pieces out because they were to tough on my teeth... first time that has happen with beef jerky."
2740,Neutral,Holy Pepper!,"I've tried a couple of other flavors of this brand and they were great, however, this pepper flavor was over the top. Way too much pepper for my taste. So much so that I couldn't eat more than a couple of pieces and I don't plan on eating any more of it."
2741,Neutral,Make sure you love garlic!,"I bought 3 lbs on sale for about half off. The thickness and dryness was nearly perfect for how I like my jerky.  The flavor was good however it is loaded with garlic.  I don't mind the flavor of garlic in moderation, but this has so much it sticks with you all day.  I went through one bag and gave away the other two.  If I was a big fan of garlic I would have given it a 4-5 star rating, but since the type was labeled ""original"" and not ""garlic"" it was an un-welcomed surprise."
2742,Neutral,Make sure you refrigerate it after opening.,"Overall, pretty good jerky.  I had a bag open for about a week, and didnt know I had to refrigerate, and it started to get funky."
2743,Neutral,Ok Jerky,"The reviews I read said this stuff was great, I thought it was OK.  Nothing special, and I don't like the fact that you have to keep it in the refrigerator."
2744,Neutral,"Could be great, but fell short!","The flavor of this jerky was good-very sweet which my husband likes. However, the texture varied greatly from melt in your mouth to shoe leather that was almost not chewable. I like a little chewiness, so both textures bothered me."
2745,Neutral,Tender jerky in some bags not others,"I really like the size of the pieces and the tenderness of the jerky I've had so far. I've only had one of the 4 packages that come in an order. I am not thrilled with the Teriyaki flavor but it's ok, not too salty. The sweet hot is really hot so beware. This brand is the first jerky I am willing to re-order, which says a lot. Usually I get grossed out by the amount of sinew in packaged jerky but I have not found much in this brand yet.<br /><br />Updating after opening all 4 bags that came in an order: 3 bags were good but the 4th bag was all gristle and fat. There was not one piece that was edible in it. So they definitely have a quality control problem. Pity, because the good pieces are quite good, though the teriyaki flavor is a bit chemical for me. Still better than most other jerky brands"
2746,Neutral,Wild Ride Beef Jerkey,This is a good tasting beef jerky but a little too salty and some pieces were too oily.
2747,Neutral,NOT Natural - Contains Nitrites,"While I read here the original flavor was natural, there was no list of ingredients available. And to my disappointment when this arrived it does indeed contain nitrites. The taste is alright, but I really would like to find jerky WITHOUT Nitrites or Nitrates. I've kept it in the fridge now for several months (i haven't had any mold issues) since I truly try to consume nitrites as little as possible, it will take a very long time to eat this or I'll end up trashing it. Please REVISE the description to be accurate! This brand DOES from my understanding have a truly natural version, that I cannot seem to find on Amazon."
2748,Neutral,Too much grissle in this jerky,"This is really tasty jerky and the price is right, but ~20-30% of the jerky strips in the bags I purchased contained some sort of ""gum-like"" inedible grissle that I end up spitting out.  I've bought 2 bags of this product approximately 30 days apart and both were like this.  I'll try one more bag for the reasons I cite above, but if the next one is like the 1st two, I'm going to stop buying this product.  It's a shame, because as I said, it really is tasty.<br /><br />UPDATE FEB 2010<br />OK ... I've kept my monthly subscription to this Jerky ...  What can I say ... Every 2nd or 3rd piece from the bags I've been delivered turns into a gum ball that I'm not willing to swallow, but it is just so darn tasty.  Dunno how long I'll stay with this, but for now ... I sort of look forward to the monthly delivery."
2749,Neutral,Abit over done,"While tasting of hickory, the flavor was abit overdone. And some portions (oddly since this is dried) tasted rather greasy."
2750,Neutral,"Good Tasting and Tender, But...","While ""Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips"" do have a good Hickory taste and are very tender (per treated), they are also fairly salty and leave a lot of ""gristle"" in your mouth. I also like that it doesn't have MSG (I'm alergic) but am disapointed that meat likely comes from outside the USA.<br /><br />On taste alone, my family is split on this jerky with 2 of us liking it (me and my son) and two of us not (my wife and daughter). We all like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPDOI"">Wild Bill's Hickory Smoked Jerky, 6.5-Ounce Package (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />I will not likely buy this brand again, even if it is on sale."
2751,Neutral,Wild Ride Beef Jerky,Not as good as some of the other beef jerky brands. The taste is a little to bland. Not enough flavor.
2752,Neutral,Almost one-quarter of this jerky is sugar.,"It's great-tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one-ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a dried beef snack, but not much different from several other brands.  In fact, most popular brands have 5 or more grams of sugar per ounce.  If you don't mind the sugar, go for it!"
2753,Neutral,Beef Jerky,"The Jerky had a nice, seasoned flavor to it, but I did not really enjoy the consistency and texture of it.  Rather than being chewy like other jerky I eat, it was much more crumbly.  Another reviewer mentioned it, but I thought that I would try it myself because I enjoy trying new things.  Not sure that I would recommend it to another jerky aficionado, but I have 3 more bags to eat and the flavor of the meat is good."
2754,Neutral,probably not from the Texas Ranch ...,"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again. As noted the claims of ""no nitrites"" in the description are false: Beef, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy protein, Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed and Soy Oil, Caramel Color), Water, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy and Corn Protein, Salt with Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed, Soybean) added), Dehydrated Garlic, Black Pepper, Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite). Serving size: 1 oz. Calories: 60 From fat: 15 Total fat 1.5g Saturated 0.5 Trans 0 Cholesterol: 20mg, Sodium: 690mg, protein: 14g."
2755,Neutral,Must be fine print in the contract......,"I stopped buying Beef Jerky to avoid the preservatives, Nitrates/Nitrites etc.  Thinking I found one without, I purchased this product after reading the words ""all natural"" in the product description.  Now that it has arrived, I found Sodium nitrite is listed on the package. Also, I might mention that after the blurb about the ""Texas Rancher"" looking for something better, I wasn't expecting the advisory on the bag that the Beef was not only sourced in the USA, but in Uruguay, New Zealand or Austrailia. Oh well, a guy can dream.<br /><br />Tastes pretty good if you close your eyes."
2756,Neutral,"Beefy, but salty","The good: the beef is cut thickly and has a steak-y taste.<br />The bad: the jerky is extremely salty to the point that it made me feel ill if I ate more than a few pieces.<br />About me: I am a rabid jerk-o-phile, and I regularly consume mass quantities of the stuff."
2757,Neutral,Some good some bad,"Overall the taste is good, but some pieces are tender, while others are hard to chew and can't be swallowed (50/50)."
2758,Neutral,The beef Jerky,"Most pieces were perfect, but about 1/4 of the bag had really chewy (fatty) meat."
2759,Neutral,No nitrites?  Look again.,"I try to stay away from buying any meats that contain nitrites and I specifically read carefully through the description of the Wild Ride jerky, and here's a direct quote: ""Wild Ride is made with all-natural ingredients with no preservatives, no MSG, and no nitrites.""<br /><br />We haven't tasted it yet, so I can't attest to that, but I was very disappointed to read in the ingredients list that it contains: ""Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite).""<br /><br />No worries if your not concerned about nitrites, but if you are, just know this product DOES contain nitrites."
2760,Neutral,"Good flavor, but too many ""hulls""","We tried McCanns oatmeal about a year ago, ordering the variety pack. It was delicious and healthy. So I decided to order one of the favorite flavors, Maple & Brown Sugar. It was still delicious and healthy, but I don't remember having so many ""hulls"" in the oatmeal. I'm assuming these little hard bits are part of the outer layer of the oat, harmless but not really edible. My daughter won't eat it now because of it, so I'm stuck with too much oatmeal. At least it keeps well, but I'd hesitate to order again."
2761,Neutral,"Decent product, large price increase","I bought this via Subscribe & Save 6 months ago.  I was ready to place another order but I've noticed that the price has increased more than 20%.  The product is a decent item that I could make my standard oatmeal choice, but I'm not interested in paying 20% more."
2762,Neutral,Instate Oatmeal,"The price is great.McCann's is a good oatmeal, but Quaker Oats has fewer calories and at least for my palate a better taste."
2763,Neutral,LESS SALT PLEASE,"It's a great TV or Computer snack item, except for too much salt. I am sure sausage can be made with lower salt content and wish this were like that."
2764,Neutral,Too much of a good thing?,"Hmm; well, I should've read the description more carefully. I didn't realise this is a natural alternative. All-the-same, the flavor, to me, was most overwhelming. Next time, well, after actually reading the directions, LOL (I just brewed like my usual coffeee which I LOVE, btw) I'll blend to dial down the flavor several notches. Also, I'm a huge almond flavor lover. Maybe I did it wrong, it's just so strong to me."
2765,Neutral,Strong flavor,"I recommend that you try this product before you order a 3 pack on Amazon that you cannot return.  I found the flavor to be very strong on the amaretto.  It is a flavor that I like, but i dont want every cup that i brew to taste like i'm drinking liquor in my coffee.  I would like to try the non-flavored varieties...I should have started with those."
2766,Neutral,Broken Cookies,"This is the second time i have ordered Moravian cookies through Amazon.com.  The cookies in themselves are delicious, however, most of them are broken because Amazon does not ship them correctly.  I will not order cookies from Amazon.com again."
2767,Neutral,Moravian Meyer Lemon Cookies,"These cookies have a great, lemony taste.  The only bad thing was that they're thin and many of them were broken."
2768,Neutral,Moravian Cookies,"THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL COOKIES AND WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO RECEIVING OUR ORDER. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY ARRIVED, MOST OF THE COOKIES WERE BROKEN INTO CRUMBS. I THINK THESE COOKIES ARE TOO THIN TO ORDER BY MAIL; BUT I WAS REIMBURSED, THANKS TO AMAZON."
2769,Neutral,"Crumbly, as was said","First off, these taste wonderful.  However, they crumble which is very annoying.<br /><br />Mine came fully intact but as I take each one out of plastic wrap inside the tubing, they just crumble in my hand before I can get them to my mouth!  Almost seems like they are too fresh and need some time to firm up!<br /><br />Found an easy solution - I just emptied the entire contents into the tube they came in and I just drink them.  LOL"
2770,Neutral,Not as good as I remember`,I've bought these cookies before and they were just wonderful.  But these were not as good as I remember and the packing makes it difficult to retrieve a cookie without breaking it.
2771,Neutral,too sweet to enjoy,"Way way too sweet.... had to return the item due to excessively high sugar content.  If available without all the unnecessary sugar added, I would be interested in purchasing again."
2772,Neutral,Kind of tough to chew!,My Springer Spaniel  ate them right away but the Malamute sniffed it a lot and finally ate them. I'll stick with the Happy Hips Chicken products.
2773,Neutral,Not sugar,"It states to use it like sugar.  Well, not exactly.  It does not work in homemade cookies.  They wanted to crumble removing them from the cookie sheet. The ones I salvaged, were OK frozen.<br /><br />And using to make homemade jam, it crystalized when the jam cooled.  Need to get it hot to use.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />Good for use by teaspoon as you do sugar."
2774,Neutral,Sticky and Glue-like,This pasta came out very sticky and 'glue-like' for me.  Maybe I cooked it wrong?  Not sure.  It did have a great flavor to it.
2775,Neutral,TASTES GREAT!  BUT KOOL-AID WORKS JUST THE SAME,"THIS PRODUCT TASTES GREAT, BUT THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING IS REALLY EXPENSIVE, AND I FOUND THAT USING REGULAR KOOL-AID DOES THE SAME THING THAT THIS FLOSS DOES, AND YOU WILL HAVE MANY MORE FLAVOR OPTIONS AS WELL."
2776,Neutral,"Great snacks, but....","These are great snacks. I was looking for healthier alternative to the Welch's fruit snacks.<br />These have fiber in them (3 g. per serving), and less sugar (9g. per serving vs 15g. in Welch's).<br />They also taste great and my son loves them. They are expensive, though. And also, there are a very few pieces of a snack per each bag - maybe five or so. They are just larger than others on the market, and they are gone in seconds. My son immediately wants more, the amount is just not sufficient.<br />I will probably buy them again (for the ingredients), but I wish they were smaller in size and had more in the bag."
2777,Neutral,"Ok, but I like Pamela's full-size cookies better","These individually wrapped gluten-free cookies are convenient to throw in a lunch bag or to grab on the run. I am actually eating my way through the pack of 100, at about 4 tiny cookies (a serving) at a time. But they are not as tasty as Pamela's regular-sized gluten-free cookies - which are superb!"
2778,Neutral,Damaged cans,I was surprised to receive 4 damaged (popped) and therefore unusable cans in this shipment.  This had never occurred previously.
2779,Neutral,"Deep but uncomplex chocolate flavor, poorly stored","I am a chocolate expert, and expected more of this chocolate than I got. It was poorly stored, so the chocolate is brittle and the cocoa butter has risen to the surface, so it's no good for nibbling, but when you melt it, i.e. for baking, it is much better. All low notes (no fruit or floral notes) makes for a chocolate that you should not use by itself in baking, it just doesn't have enough complexity. But mixed with other chocolates it will provide solid support."
2780,Neutral,"Good, but clumpy","This organic Mexican spice tastes great and I love that it is Organic. The only reason I gave it 3 stars, was because it was so compacted and stuck together, that I had to use a fork to open up the whole top, then mash away at the block of spice for quite a while, before it separated enough to use."
2781,Neutral,False Advertising?,"I was a real fan of this line of dog treats until one day, I noticed on the back of the bag, the fine print, that read, ""MADE IN CHINA"". How can a dog treat that states cage free chickens and all natural come from China? Its rare to hear of a cage free chicken coup in China of all places. And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least. I have since found better alternatives that I can be more comfortable in giving my dog, such as Plato Natural Organic Chicken made here in the USA."
2782,Neutral,My dog loves these but...,"I have to agree that I am not comfortable with treats made in China, and also find it difficult to believe in the all-natural, cage-free claims. Why not make them in the U.S.? I am trying to decide if I should keep the ones I already have or throw them away and get something I trust. The company claims they test for many dangerous chemicals and additives, but some enterprising criminal somewhere is bound to come up with something that nobody has thought to test for, imo. That's what I'm afraid of. *sigh*"
2783,Neutral,Super Sticky Snack Bars,"This is the first product that I have tried from this company, and it was just ok.  It mostly tastes like peanuts, even though almonds are the first ingredient listed.  There is an an underlying fruity note, but it is not very assertive.<br /><br />The main problem with these bars is the lack of crunch.  They are so chewy as to be almost too much trouble to eat.  Part of that problem may lie with the fact that the box sat in the sun for an hour in 90 degree heat after the mailperson delivered it.  However, other reviewers reported that the bars were very sticky so the heat may not be entirely to blame.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product."
2784,Neutral,"Delicious, But Half The Calories Are From Fat","These Pure Natural Bars are absolutely delicious and good for you, but not good for your waistline. Loaded with cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts, they are simply a sticky and crunchy delight. All berries strengthen your artery walls and do wonders for your body, as do nuts, so these bars excel at giving you much more than fiber.<br /><br />Each bar has 190 calories, 100 calories from fat. The sodium is low at 95 mg and the cholesterol is zero. This is one of those treats that your body needs, but because of the fat calories- not that often. Two cupcakes also have 100 calories from fat, but of course don't give you this great artery protection and fiber. This is a great healthy bar to have once a week, but never daily, as it's difficult to burn off 100 fat calories."
2785,Neutral,Not bad,"So far the one box I opened didn't make me sick or anything, so I'm assuming the other three boxes I ordered will be around the same quality. It's a little salty for my taste, but the bars have good ingredients and seem to be of high quality. I'd recommend trying."
2786,Neutral,"There's a lot to like here, but the flavor didn't do it for me...","There's a lot to like with these bars. They're a lot healthier than some other bars out there and the company seems to be commited to quality food. In the end though this particular flavor just didn't do it for me. On the go I would likely reach for something that pleased my palate more. If I was intentionally looking for something healthy I would pack some of these away. On quality and composition I would rate them higher, but taste counts for something too..."
2787,Neutral,Good Snack,"Pure natural bars are a good snack if you are on the go, and need something between meals.  They live up to their billing in that they are basically a plethora of nuts and fruits together in bar form, and the taste is quite good.  They certainly are packed full of nuts and fruit, but in the process of holding them together they can become a bit sticky.  The protein content is pretty good as well (5g), and they are not heavy on calories.  The main downside to the bars is the high fat content for a bar.  However, if you are looking for a natural snack, loaded with nuts and fruits this is the bar you will want to pick up."
2788,Neutral,Ouch,"Ouch is what my poor gums would say after eating this bar. Pure  Natural Bars, Superfruit Nutty Crunch is just too hard. If you enjoy eating these types of hard bars that are on the sweeter side, then you may enjoy this.<br /><br />Pros: natural bar is gluten free, vegan, kosher, natural ingredients (the only reasons I have it 3 stars)<br /><br />Cons: too hard & sticky, there's too much sugar in it (or evaporated cane sugar) 12 grams of sugar is not a good trade off for only 5 grams of protein, it should be the opposite.<br /><br />I wouldn't want my young child eating this, unless I plan on brushing his teeth right afterwards and checking on his little gums to make sure they have not been irritated."
2789,Neutral,Delicious yet sticky,"I really like the taste and balanced nutrition & sugar amount in this product but the stickiness is rather a disappointment. Straight to the pros and cons of this fruit&nut bar:<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Tastes great; balanced sweet and savoury.<br />+ Right amount of nutrition, balanced sugar too. Less sweet compared to the typical energy bar.<br />+ Vegan and Gluten-free. Great choice if you have a special diet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The 'syrup mix' that makes the nuts and berries stick together is very sticky. The wrapper tend to stick to the bar so it's not so easy to peel it open.<br />- I eat energy bar as quick breakfast or snack on the go. Having my lips and fingertips sticky after eating this isn't a nice feeling especially when there's no tissue/water around to wipe it off.<br /><br />If you don't mind the stickiness, this product is a great addition to your choice of healthier snack, for a healthier lifestyle."
2790,Neutral,Not Nearly As Good As Their Raw(Organic) Bars,"I have tasted every Pure Bar in the Organic line and like them all.  I love the balance of flavors in the line and the raw aspect makes them feel good to eat.<br /><br />I was so excited to taste the Pure Natural Bars Superfruit Nutty Crunch bars that I could hardly wait to get them.  Once I opened the package though, something just didn't hit me right.  I didn't know that these were different from the organic line when I first tasted it.  I knew after the first bite, however.<br /><br />Compared to the Pure Organic Bars which are raw, these are really a disappointment to me.  The flavor is intense, for sure, but it seemed out of balance.  I tasted quite a few different bars just to be sure.<br /><br />The superfruit taste has a tangy aftertaste which is not too bad, but then there is the taste that almost assaults my senses- like over salted peanuts.  The salt in this is not listed as sea salt and it tastes way too strong for my liking.<br /><br />The blueberry pomegranate and cranberry flavor adds nice contrast but the harsh salty peanut taste really interrupts the flow of flavors in my mouth.  I just am not fond of it.<br /><br />As for texture, they are very soft, sticky, and intense in flavor, so that is not a problem.  The texture is very nice as far as crunch balanced with substance and sticky feeling.  The sweet is not overbearing, but is pretty well balanced, much of it coming from the dried fruit.<br /><br />In summary, if you love the Pure Organic Raw bars, you might not like these.  If you love cooked granola bars that are sticky and sweet like sticky buns, and you love peanuts, you might like these.<br /><br />I prefer the raw bars.  My daughter liked them all right, but she eats peanut butter by the pound and dumps half a shaker of salt on many of her meals.  :)  If you are like her, give these a try.  She loves them.  I have given them three stars as an average between her and my reaction to them."
2791,Neutral,Healthy but ...,"I had looked forward to trying out these healthy snack bars, and wound up with mixed emotions about them. Here are some pluses and minuses:<br /><br />Pluses<br />(1) The ingredients in these bars are tops in nutritional value -- vegan and gluten free.<br />(2) The packaging is convenient for carrying the snack in a purse or briefcase.<br />(3) The sugar content is high enough to satisfy, but low enough to still be healthy.<br /><br />Minuses<br />(1) The bars are so sticky that it is difficult to remove them from their wrappers, and the contents stick to your teeth as well as your hands.<br />(2) If you refrigerate them, they become less sticky but too tough to bite and chew.<br /><br />Suggestions<br />(1) It might help if the bars were dusted with powdered sugar (or perhaps rice flour) to reduce their stickiness.<br />(2) Perhaps something less sticky could be used to bind the components together.<br /><br />I was very disappointed to discover that I cannot use these bars for my afternoon snack -- they are just too hard to handle. I do commend the makers of the product for a good try at creating a tasty and nutritious snack bar."
2792,Neutral,Packaging Impossible to Open,"These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer."
2793,Neutral,"A decent vegan snack, tbut with some drawbacks.","The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn-off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot. The flavor is nice, and has a decent aftertaste. The texture is OK, but not what I would expect from a ""jerky"".. I would have preferred something much chewier. I did eat them, but it's not something I will purchase again."
2794,Neutral,If you ever wondered what it must be like to be a cannibal...,"... then these strips are for you.  A friend of mine introduced me to them, and admittedly, they taste pretty good, but the seitan has a color and texture that will make you think you are eating human flesh.  It's horrifying, and yet afterwards you'll be craving more, which is all the more horrifying.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for taste, 1 star for cannibalism... 3 stars overall."
2795,Neutral,I'm torn...but I'm still eating them.,"I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky."
2796,Neutral,"Decent, but a little odd","I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more."
2797,Neutral,"Good flavor, but a wet mess","I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."
2798,Neutral,Teriyaki flavor primal strips,"Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake-feet products: this is not one of them."
2799,Neutral,Not that good.,"Before I was vegetarian, there were few meat products that I even liked. Jerky was one of them, and I have had no luck finding a replacement.<br /><br />This is NOTHING like real jerky. It is very chewy in a SOFT way, and the flavoring was overpowering to the point that I ended up with a stomachache.<br /><br />It is OK. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not disgustingly bad or anything. Just know if you're looking for an alternative to jerky that this fails both the taste and texture test."
2800,Neutral,Inconsistent,"I tried cocoa nibs during a recent chocolate tasting I attended so I expected the unsweetened, bitter quality of the nibs (taste). These, however, are a disappointment. The pieces are not consistent in flavor or texture from piece to piece (and the pieces are small). Some pieces have a vinegar-like undertone to the taste while others have the cocoa quality I expect. There seems to be a lot of shell fragments so I will need to re-process the pieces before using them in cookies. While the package says they are recommended for cookies, I wouldn't dare put these into a cookie dough without processing and close inspection. I received 2 shipments (one of which was the nibs) and then found a bug under the boxes so I can't tell where it originated (yuck). I thoroughly examined one package (I purchased 2) and found no critters so I plan to use them even though it means extra work for me. I don't suggest these for bakers."
2801,Neutral,Fermented?,"Not my favorite food. When I opened the bag the smell attacked me, it smelled like very strong wine, which is not my favorite smell. I still tasted it raw and again, not good.<br /><br />I have not given up yet though, I am certain I can bake with these and it will taste good. Fingers crossed because I do not want to have wasted my money."
2802,Neutral,Awesome service from this seller,"I was shocked how quickly this product came. I saw these on Dr. Oz and wanted to give them a try for a chocolate snack to cure my cravings for sweets. They are quite bitter though. I know dark chocolate with cacao can be more bitter than milk chocolate but I wasn't expecting it to be so hard to take. The seller's service was great, but I don't know that I will order these again due to the taste."
2803,Neutral,OK,"Just ok.  I need to leave twenty + words, so la la la la la la la la la la.<br /><br />Good quality, buy locally: I will next time."
2804,Neutral,Good quality seeds,"These are good quality pumpkin seeds. Virtually all of the seeds are whole seeds (vs. some companies where the seeds are broken and cracked). I have no complaint about the seed quality, but the shipping costs from this seller are high even if you order a number of items together. Ordering just one or two items is out of the question because shipping costs are so high. On the plus side, the costs for many of their items are very low, so it can cancel out the high shipping. Be aware that if you order more than one item at a time in the same order, shipping is reduced on a per item basis, so take that into consideration when you see over $10 shipping for a couple tiny items!"
2805,Neutral,Meh,They were ok.  They had a strange plasticy smell about them.  Several small brown peices like they were overcooked or went bad.  A few peices with those little bugs in them.  Next time I'm just going to buy them from my local Indian grocery.
2806,Neutral,"Pretty good, but seemed to go stale",I found that about a month before the expiration date these tasted stale to me.  So have several bags left from the case I bought that are not that good anymore.  I bought the sniders organic pretzels and those held up better.
2807,Neutral,contains WHEAT!!,"We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'.  The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'.  Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.  As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5....  'a little bland...need more salt.'"
2808,Neutral,"Sent me ""OLD"" product","I ordered a case of these pretzels to give away as snacks--I ordered it on Dec 17 and when it came, it had the ""Use By Dec 27, 2011"" date stamped on each bag. I'm not happy that they sent me ""old"" product that is nearing the end of its shelf life."
2809,Neutral,good price,"Purchased these on sale around superbowl time when we go through lots of dips.  Normally buy locally, but the town was sold out and we try to be as organic as possible.  Family has mixed reviews about taste & texture."
2810,Neutral,Not exactly the item pictured.,"The bottle in the picture shows the 12 year aged balsamic (notice the 12 Roman numerals around the neck label of the bottle). The one being sold here is the 6 year aged balsamic, as the text states."
2811,Neutral,Expected better.,"This is a pleasant balsamic, but only that. It has a pronounced flavor profile that begins enjoyably enough, but becomes reminiscent of molasses or burnt caramel. I wonder at the methods used to create it's silkiness and body, especially given its youthful age. As another reviewer mentioned, it tastes cooked. It's a decent balsamic, there are simply better choices available for the price."
2812,Neutral,Bought for a gift,I bought this as a gift to my Uncle and Aunt who are amazing cooks.  They were very happy to received it.
2813,Neutral,If you love almonds?,"i like these nuts. they're fresh and in a nice container. but there are too many almonds and not enough of everything else. but if you love almonds, buy it!!"
2814,Neutral,"Almonds should be listed first on the label, not cashews","The label says it contains 'cashews, almonds, brazil nuts, hazelnuts, and pecans'.  True enough but at least half of the mix is almonds which get old in a hurry.  The quality if fine but not the blend of the mix."
2815,Neutral,delicious nuts,nice assortmet of nuts.fine quality.goodd sizebut i prefer ligtly salted; these had a dry flavor that made me thirsty
2816,Neutral,sams club,Cheaper at Sams Club now even with S&S. Like the ease but the prices are not that competitive anymore. Will wait to renew at a later date..or not.
2817,Neutral,Good but a little salty,"I liked the nuts and will probably re-order, but the nuts were more salty than I was expecting.  They taste good, so I am planning to reorder when I run out."
2818,Neutral,Too many almonds,"There are too many almonds in both containers.  I'm not a big fan of almonds, but if you like almonds, you will definitely like these.<br /><br />Overall, the nuts tasted pretty fresh, but personally I thought it was too salty."
2819,Neutral,Durkee French's Pan Rich Brown Gravy,"Durkee is a brand that I trust and have never had a problem with.  This however I purchased because the picture shows what looks like a tall slender plastic bottle that I thought would have a flip top plastic lift area to pour from.,, so I could use small amounts from the pantry as needed.  Instead, the product came in one paper type package that does not reseal itself.  of course I will use a sealed plastic container to store....but I will not take another chance of ordering related to the product pictured as opposed to what was delivered."
2820,Neutral,"Good, but not great","Described as ""roasted"" as well as ""salted"", they are in fact roasted, but not well salted and taste more like a ""low salt"" product."
2821,Neutral,Worcestershire-centric,"...and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Worcestershire is the key ingredient here and it's also my secret ingredient for pea soup and clam chowdah... oops, secret's out. IMHO, a bit pricey at $3.99, which is what I paid locally. Here it's $6.90 - I mean ""$1.95"" plus shipping - which is madness.<br /><br />Good flavor, but it has limitations for me, as does Worcestershire."
2822,Neutral,Declining quality  of Taste of the Wild cat food,"I just realized that whole chicken has been deleted from the ingredients' list and that only chicken meal is used.  The protein content has also gone from 45% to 42%, which still sounds good, but I wonder how much of this protein is actually from meat.  Cats can only assimilate meat protein.<br /><br />I have decided not to use this food for my cats anymore."
2823,Neutral,"I got a sample from a pet shop, but....","I got a sample from a pet shop, as I wanted to try grain-free food for my cats. Unfortunately, none of my cats wanted to eat the kibbles. They sniffed it, and turn away, tails and nose high in the air. They loved Orijen cat food and Fussie Cat wet food, by the way. I think they (my cats) are just choosy :("
2824,Neutral,Cats won't eat this product,"After deciding to switch to a grainless product, I was happy to find this food.  I think the price and the ingredients are good, and my cats liked it when first introduced.  Now they won't eat it (after a couple of bags).  I have tried both flavors and they refuse it.  I don't know what has caused them to reject the food, but since I have more than ten cats and ALL refuse the food, it must be the product.  There was no problem with litter box odor and the change in their appearance was positive.  I am still looking for another product. By the way, the cost of the premium food is worth the improvement in the cats' appearance and decrease in litter usage."
2825,Neutral,Unfortunately,"I was very happy to find holistic cat food on Amazon that was eligible for the prime membership free shipping.  I tried both the dry and canned food since my cats eat both.  Unfortunately my cats do not like this food - only one will eat the canned food and this same cat will not eat the dry, and oddly enough, vice versa.  The other cat will eat the dry but not the canned.  I have also noticed that their coats are not as silky as they were with another brand, which I will be going back to. I am giving it 3 stars as it is a good holistic food and conveniently available, just is not something my cats like."
2826,Neutral,The price shot up $5.50 a bag!!!!,"My cats love this food.  I loved it for them.  But I've been paying $11.99 and free shipping for the last year.  Now it has gone up to $17.50.  Too high for me.  I will purchase elsewhere.  I'm finding so many things for better prices then Amazon lately.  Too bad, I liked having one place to shop that I trusted to have the best price."
2827,Neutral,phew!,"My cats enjoy this product well enough - they actually eat less of this than they ate of their old food and seem satisfied. I like that it's grain free and made with what seems like good ingredients. But I will say this - the litterbox odor has gotten ridiculous since I started feeding this food. I've never smelled anything like it. I now have to scoop at least twice a day, every day, or it's unbearable. Their, uh, output has increased significantly. If you live in a small residence, be forewarned!"
2828,Neutral,Fazer Milk Chocolate with Hazelnuts,"I tried this a few years ago, and thought it was great.  It's certainly much better than chocolate from your local grocery store.  Recently though, I've tried Ritter Sport, and have decided that it's better.  So for those of you who are looking for something that's better than what you can get at your local grocery store, you're definitely in for a treat with this, but you might want to  give Ritter a try also."
2829,Neutral,Not so fresh,"This is a very good brand of popcorn, but what we received from Amazon was quite a bit tougher than what we get from the local grocery store. Kinda sorry I bought it.<br /><br />By the way, it's just plain popcorn; I don't know why Amazon describes it as seasoned."
2830,Neutral,Problems with bbq sauce but seller very good about it,"I had ordered 6 bottles of the Lum Taylor Riverboat style barbeque sauce from Healthy Heart Market. I have used this BBQ sauce for several years and we love it, especially since it is very low in sodium and also delicious. However, three of the bottles leaked terribly and were unusable, 2 bottles leaked slightly, and one seemed fine. Since my husband has had a heart transplant and we must be very careful about what he eats, I will have to stop ordering this item until the manufacturer figures out a way to seal the bottles better. Healthy Heart Market did issue me a credit for 3 bottles and for half of the shipping, so they were very good in the way they handled it. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031DW704"">Lum Taylor's Riverboat Style Barbeque Sauce 18oz</a>"
2831,Neutral,It's white bread,"We purchased this for a new breadmaker we received since you can't really buy breadmaker mixes in stores anymore. The price is great, they come in a six-pack that is not all that large and we find it convenient to be able to just quickly make a loaf of bread without having to pull out the recipe book and add lots of ingredients.  These make a 1 1/2 pound loaf if you're interested and it is pretty easy to make, just dump in the water, then the flour mix, some butter and the yeast...turn it on and wait! Overall, though, we found the taste to be pretty bland.  There is nothing special about the bread from this mix at all, but they have other flavors that are much tastier in my opinion for about the same price.  If you are looking for plain, white bread, then this will work out just fine."
2832,Neutral,Bread would not rise,"Out of the 6 boxes of bread, only 2 came out correctly; the other 4 were flat as if the yeast was no good.  Of course being in Afghanistan with a bread maker, I could not just run out and buy some more yeast.  Our experience was not good; they did love the bread that came out good."
2833,Neutral,Poor factory packaging,"While it makes good bread, I've been very disappointed with it due to every single box that I've opened to date (4 boxes so far) having its plastic packaging inside not sealed along the vertical seam. Apparently the adhesive used to seal the plastic bag containing the mix didn't hold, or if heat was used to seal the seam, that technique didn't work either."
2834,Neutral,Lacking in Taste,"This was ok, but not as tasty as other bread mixes I've used in the past. I'll try the honey wheat next."
2835,Neutral,"easy, tasty and reliable bread mix","howdy y'all,<br /><br />this bread smells like what i was expecting to smell while baking. the other breads haven't had that ""bakery"" scent while this one certainly does!<br /><br />made it with olive oil and with vegetable oil - the olive oil version is noticeably tastier.<br /><br />rated a THREE since it is exactly as expected. easy, tasty and predictable.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
2836,Neutral,"Taste great, but won't rise...","I got the wholesome white bread mix, and I like the taste of it.  The only problem I have is I can't get it to rise in my bread machine.  I turns out great but it is a mini loaf.  I tried mixing it is the machine, and mixing it by hand and cooking it in my machine and I get the same results.  I have not tried making it in the oven which is another option."
2837,Neutral,Not quite sure..,"This rice had a definite earthy flavor, but it also had a slightly musty undertone, and a slight bitterness. I rinsed it well before cooking.  The color was nowhere near ruby, but it was more of a medium dark brown with a reddish or slightly purple blush.  I'll eat it, but I won't buy it again. It's too expensive and not special enough to justify the cost.  I much prefer Lotus Foods Forbidden rice."
2838,Neutral,"A fun bit of nostalgia, but overpriced","Fun selection of goodies.  However, the product cost is high and the shipping cost is even higher.  I feel it is overpriced, especially considering the majority of items are still available individually at local stores."
2839,Neutral,A BIT OF FUN NOT A TON!,"Thank God, I had the package delivered directly to my home before handing it over as a gift. The package is a wonderful idea; However, I was slightly disappointed in the presentation and the lack of items used. This gift is a bit of fun not a ton of fun nor a pound of candy! I was underwhelmed with how little of product received for the cost paid. The excitment of opening the package was taken down a notch or two by the tacky paper used and the poor presentation of the items within. The chocolate seemed old and a lot of the candies were unidentifiable due to perhaps it being from the East Coast rather the West. I strongly suggest having the gift box delivered to you before giving. This will enable you to locate and fill the box completely with more nostalgia goodies unlike what the company claims to be included. It was a blast reminising on the past! Now, my only hope is that this gift box brings the receiver the same joy I got after the box was completed with more candy and festive decorations purchased from Target and the Dollar Store around town. Overall, this is a fun gift that lacks charm due to it's presentation and lack of candy! Eat responsibly!"
2840,Neutral,No Reggie Bar??!!,"Great idea, but why not pay homage to the most iconic candy of the decade? The chocolate, the caramel, the peanuts, the packaging, the salty goodness! The world has yet to see another candy to carry the name of a sports figure. Bring back the Reggie Bar and it'll sell like hotcakes."
2841,Neutral,Retro Candy,The box contained a sampling of items from 1970s.  Some of the items were old and not really edible.  Expected more in the box for the price.
2842,Neutral,"Yeah, but has it got Pop Rocks?","Unless it has real, live Pop Rocks that actually explode in your mouth, I'm not interested.  And where are the Fire Stix?"
2843,Neutral,"good, not great",They were good. The foil kinda awkwardly sticks to the chocolate so its kinda like getting into a sticky fort knox. But tasty.
2844,Neutral,Better than most,"While I can taste the sourness that turned off the previous reviewer, it didn't come close to ruining the meal. Far from it in fact. I believe they may have used bad yogurt.<br /><br />This was a good grocery solution to tikka masala at home. It's not going to be as good as your favorite Indian restaurant but, if you follow the directions and go with the recommended overnight marinade, the chicken will be tender. I did not go with the optional 1/4 cup yogurt added in at the end of the cooking process. It was still very flavorful and unmistakably tikka masala."
2845,Neutral,not really low carb,"Taste like cardboard, but I added quite a bit of cinnamon and maple syrup.  I then added milk and put in microwave.<br /><br />The nutrition information shows about same carbs as regular cereal."
2846,Neutral,Did not work for us,"My dog refuses to eat these snacks.  I was expected that these snacks have a strong liver smell, however they smell like plastic..."
2847,Neutral,not as good as the chicken strips,"My dog is crazy for the Dogswell chicken strips but these she's not excited about. These are crunchy like a pressed cracker, not a meat strip, and not as chewy."
2848,Neutral,Retired in Texas,"We have purchased these treats several times for our aging Bichon and been well pleased.  She loves them; however, this last batch is tough and really dried out."
2849,Neutral,Great pretzels but too expensive here,"You can get these at your local Costco for less than 8 dollar, not worth what they are being sold for here.  Other than that they taste great."
2850,Neutral,elk chew,my dog doesn't like the elk horn at all.. she is a poodle and I guess because she can't really chew on it it is not appealing.. maybe if I got the split one she would have liked it better???
2851,Neutral,Just okay.,"I was hoping these would have a little more thickness or size to them, the pieces are really small and thin.  But the flavor is good, and I love that its only 100 calories for the WHOLE pack and 3 grams of fiber!<br />Probably won't order again, but I'll keep these and snack on them at work instead of hitting the vending machine."
2852,Neutral,Okay,"These were okay, expected a little more flavor.  Probably would not buy them again, a little to pricey."
2853,Neutral,Seems to help but tastes BAD!,"I've been giving this a try. It doesn't make me fall asleep faster or stay asleep longer, but I think I get a better quality of sleep with it, so that although I'm not getting any more sleep than without it, I wake up without the usual headache and the lead-weight exhaustion that I usually wake up with.<br /><br />The down side is that it tastes absolutely horrid. If you're trying it for the first time, get the cap off and take it down FAST, before you can change your mind.<br /><br />Be careful (or maybe ask a doc) if you combine it with allergy meds. It claims to have no contraindications, but when taking it with cetirizine HCL (a generic OTC allergy medication), I found it resulted in dizziness. Nothing in the product should cause that reaction on its own, but perhaps one of the inactive ingredients interacts with the cetirizine HCL. Definitely wouldn't take the two together if I were flying -- it might contribute to motion sickness, and also there's the issue of unstable footing, if a person had to move about on the aircraft."
2854,Neutral,Tastes bad; just buy some L-Trytophan if you want sleep!,"The main ingredient is L-Trytophan which can be purchased on its own or in the product 5-HTP.  This water induced a sleepiness but the snoozeberry tastes like berries smothered in Sweet and Low.  In addition, the little bottles cost $2.99 at my local store.  If you are in a PINCH, take this water.  If you want something with the same affect find a Valerian and 5-Htp product."
2855,Neutral,What it is....,"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh."
2856,Neutral,nice product,It is a nice product with an easy to use sprinkler. I like the cheesy flavour and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking at introducing a cheesy flavour to their meals without the added calories from real cheese. So far i have added it to pasta and its delish!
2857,Neutral,Eh,"Although I love coconut oil and know of all the benficial ways to use it, this coconut oil tastes too coconutty for me.  I have to agree with other reviewers in that the smell is so strong it almost seems like an artificial scent. I dont mind coconut flavor and scents but this is almost too much.  It almost makes me gag.  I'll be going with Nutiva next time."
2858,Neutral,Food Product Review,The coconut oil arrived in good condition.  It had a stronger taste than conventional cooking oils that I did not care for.
2859,Neutral,It's Okay ...,"Purhcased this for Christmas Dinner and shared with family. No rave reviews from anyone. Usually everyone enjoys our coffee but no one, not a one, commented on this brew (which isn't a good thing). We ground the beans right before roasting, tried a few different racios and realized that you need an extra amount of coffee per cup to give it flavor. Flavor is what we're after as coffee people but, this fell short of the rave reviews on Amazon. We never told anyone at Christmas Dinner about the coffee so we would get a ""clean"" report. Got nothing back and that's not good. For ourselves, we didn't find anything but flatness in this. It might be good to cut this with Kona. We're going to try that out. This is far too expensive to throw out so we have to find a way to enjoy it. We have used other Blue Mountain coffees and love it.  We do NOT recommend this particular coffee."
2860,Neutral,"Decent coffee, but ridiculously priced for not fresh coffee","I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started."
2861,Neutral,Not as hard to find as some people think,"My girlfriend loves this gum and told me she cannot find it anywhere, so I preceded to place a large online order. The next day I was at the local grocery store and found about 50 3-packs of this gum in the sale aisle. It was also available at Target. Moral of the story, if you dont feel like waiting for amazon to ship it, just drive to your grocery store. I was also told you can't keep the gum in the plastic container in your car in the summer bc it would melt.....NOT TRUE..."
2862,Neutral,"great gum, but overpriced on line","I love this gum. In fact, I chew it all day.  I was happy to discover it packed in a plastic container.  Hated to waste all that paper having it individually.<br />I priced it a local store, though, and found it much cheaper to buy."
2863,Neutral,The Sweet Stuff,"In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.<br /><br />Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand. The quality is not as good but the flavor is many times better."
2864,Neutral,jerky average,no better than oberto's in our family's opinion. we've had better in Colorado. The taste was typical teriyaki jerky and the pieces on the whole were tough.
2865,Neutral,product review is different for the two different types they carry,"If you are looking for traditional jerky, you will want to order the slab style, which I would give 4 stars. High marks for hormone free and vegetarian fed. Their regular jerky is nothing like you would expect and I would only give it two stars, because the product description does not accurately reflect what you are getting. It is not thin, dried strips of buffalo. It is chopped up, extruded, and sliced into ""O"" shapes. If you look at the product packaging for their regular jerky, look at the letter ""O"" in buffalo. The name itself indicates that you have ""O"" shapes inside, but nowhere in the name or description is that mentioned. I'm sure many people will like this, but it's definitely not the ""jerky experience"" that most are looking for when they buy jerky."
2866,Neutral,Ground Meat Overly Sugarized Then Pressed Into Circle Patties,"This stuff is made from ground meat then formed into circle patties. It tastes OK, but not the quality of many grocery store brand jerkies. I am not going to buy this product anymore nor would I recommend it.<br /><br />The best buffalo jerky I have ever found is the Trader Joe's brand. They take whole pieces of thinly sliced buffalo steak and have sweet or spicy flavors. Great stuff!"
2867,Neutral,Review,The description and photo on this product needs to be changed to indicate this product is the BuffalOs version of this beef jerky.
2868,Neutral,2.5 stars really - too sweet,"I have just gotten the turkey, beef and buffalo from this company. The beef jerky had a highly processed feel and was way way too sweet and was not the best quality meet. The turkey was decent, and for the price pretty good with thicker pieces and not as much over-sweetening. This buffalo is in the middle of the two. This jerky is still way too sweet, but the pieces and meat quality are much better than the beef jerky. I  probably will re-order the turkey, will never re-order the beef, and am on the fence for this one. Worth a try, but be prepared to find it too sweet!"
2869,Neutral,Too Hot,"I like the other jerky products I have tried from Golden Valley very much, but the Sweet N' Spicy Buffalo Jerky is a bit too hot for my taste.  I thought ""sweet and spicy"" meant medium hot since it wasn't called ""Sweet and hot"".  This jerky is hot.  It is hard to appreciate the jerky or the sweetness of it if your mouth is burning.  Actually, it is not burning red hot, but is a little too hot for someone who likes spicy to be a little less than medium on the hotness scale.  The jerky itself is wonderful - just the right amount of tenderness and chewiness.  If you like a little less than medium hotness, then try a different flavor of their jerky - they're great!"
2870,Neutral,Sorry to give these up -- afraid of cancer recurrence,"The flavor of these bars is very, very good.  They are filling and have many good nutritive qualities.<br /><br />That being said, we have to stop buying these bars.  They are using soy protein isolate, which probably met two of the manufacturer's goals:<br /><br />1) Vegetarian/non dairy<br />2) Save money -- that is one cheap-o source of protein<br /><br />Although we all know that an alternative -- WHEY protein from cross-microfiltration -- is the highest form of protein available right now, it is expensive.  It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.<br /><br />""Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity. GMPs and other immune-boosting components remain intact.""<br /><br />informational reference:  www &lt;dot> sportswhey &lt;dot> com/science_ion_exchange.htm<br /><br />Aside from the problem we have with the grossly inferior form of protein they are using, our main reason for stopping with this product is this:<br /><br />>>>>> We don't want our cancer to return. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />We have had breast cancer, and it was estrogen positive.  Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS.<br /><br />Research backs this up.<br /><br />These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects.<br /><br />Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS.<br /><br />Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them.<br /><br />The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively.<br /><br />We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor."
2871,Neutral,Perhaps too compostable?,"I bought these bags to go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017WOFSI"">Exaco Trading ECO-2000 2.4 Gallon Kitchen Compost Waste Collector</a> that I purchased on Amazon. The bags fit perfectly, but they seem to start degrading within a few days. If I took out compost every day, it would be fine, but I empty my compost bucket about twice a week. When I lift a bag to take it outside, it is dripping, so I have to take the whole bucket out and scrub it thoroughly afterwards to get rid of the odor. Previously, when I used a regular plastic shopping bag, leakage was almost never a problem, but it is a regular occurance with these liners. I like that the bags are biodegradable, but rather than purchasing these again, I'll probably go back to re-using plastic bags when my supply runs out--unless I find a sturdier brand. Any suggestions?"
2872,Neutral,Takes Getting Used To!,Its not that these bags are bad - its really more that it takes some time to get used to a compostable bag!!  they aren't as 'strong' as the regular bags you're probably used to (and that goes for me too) so it has taken me some time to get used to the fact these bags don't stand up very long to let's say compost material - but I will say that if you are diligent about getting your composte down to the bin more frequently it is nice to be able to just throw bag and all into the bin!
2873,Neutral,Leaking,"Perhaps it's because I fill them too much, but the bags leak liquid from fruits, etc. They seem sturdy but don't hold up to a lot of weight."
2874,Neutral,"They are as advertised, but....","These compostable bags are definitely that. They will break down, and so are pretty perfect for your typical compostable kitchen waste. However, they are super thin and will break down in your composting bin as well. Maybe not every time, but we have seen about 25% of them begin to break down and leak long before we actually fill it our bin. I would say the average time before the bag begins to leek is around a week. Like I say, not all these bags are apparently created equal, as some do maintain their integrity longer, but it isnt something I would rely on. You are better served changin it out at least once a week, and maybe more often. Dont wait just because you havent prepped as many veggies and fruit this week."
2875,Neutral,Delicious product but made with ingredients from China,I really do like these to snack on however I'm really put off by the fact that this company always imports their ingredients from China. I'm Asian and I just never purchase food products from China. Most Asians don't purchase food from China either. I know these are not made in China however you just never know what type of pesticides and what kind of contaminants are in their soil that inevitable ends up in nuts and fruits used in these products. Just to err on the side of caution I will not be purchasing this product again.
2876,Neutral,treats fall apart,My golden is a finicky eater and didn't really care for the treats.  He seems to like the soft treats better than the hard ones.  And when he does eat one of the treats it ends up in little pieces on the floor.
2877,Neutral,My dogs would not eat these,"I know everyone else likes them... but they are very dry, like an old cookie, and my dogs wont eat them.  I have two Havanese dogs.<br /><br />1/1/2010:  Update:  My dogs are starting to eat these now. I've increased the rating to 3."
2878,Neutral,Mixed review on these,"These arrived quickly as I ordered them on a lightning deal. They look fabulous, they smell even better, they were fresh, they were attractive looking...................the problem? My 2 Yorkies won't touch them........sniff them and then walk away........even cut up in little pieces. I'll have to give them away unless I get desperate for cookies and decide to eat them myself!"
2879,Neutral,please watch out!,I just received these pretzels but have not tasted them yet because I noticed under the ingredients on the package that it says may contain traces of sesame or poppy seeds.  My son is allergic to sesame seeds and this was not stated on the website under ingredients.  I notified Amazon and they will look into this.
2880,Neutral,Many broken pieces during shipping?,"I ordered a case & was dismayed that all the bags contained 70% broken pieces.  I bought these for my gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free son & for small children, broken food is a big deal.  I will pursue a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Once you can get past the broken pieces, they taste good."
2881,Neutral,not bad,"as far as gluten free products go - these aren't bad.  seems like nothing is really ""good"" so the best you can hope for is not terribly unpalatable."
2882,Neutral,good tea but has lemon taste,"I've been trying to find a drink to replace the sodas that I drink daily and while I like tea, I don't like the amount of sugar I have to put in the tea to enjoy it. I've read several reviews and thought I would try it. Well I guess I didn't read all the reviews and thought it would be important to let people know that while this tea is pretty good, it has a lemon taste to it. Now for some people they like lemon in their tea, but I don't like lemon at all. I will say that the lemon flavor is not as strong as some lemon teas i've tasted, so I will try to develope a taste for it, but if you don't like lemon in your tea you probably won't fall in love with this tea."
2883,Neutral,Good for experimenting.,"It's a little odd to get 8 loose K-cups in a package, but I couldn't figure out another way to go through a number of them, from different brands, to see what I wanted before ordering 24 of them.  Glad I did... some of the items in this package tasted great, some of them were mediocre, and a few were vile, one brand of cider tasting remarkably similar to what Red Bull and shampoo mixed together probably tastes like."
2884,Neutral,Needed Food Processor,"This stuff tastes fine, but each package contained big chunks of the cereal, too big to eat with milk, but okay as a dry snack.  I had to put each pack in my food processor to break it up.  Breadshop and Bear Naked are better and less trouble!"
2885,Neutral,"OK, but King Oscar is the best brand.","Reasonably tasty, kind of ugly in the can, no comparison with the King Oscar Brisling crosspack in olive oil (which is much more expensive)."
2886,Neutral,"Easy open can is great, but this is not my favorite mid-size sardine.","I've decided after two cans that this is the first Season sardine product that I'd rate just average.<br /><br />But first, at least someone invented a sardine can that's easy to open!  Just peel the plastic sheet back and there's your fresh sardines!  No metal top to snap back and splatter oil all over you.  Gotta love it!<br /><br />However, the Matiz Gallego Sardines in Olive Oil look better and taste way fresher, although the cans are made of heavier metal and are far harder to open than any other sardines I've tried.  So if you like these, you owe it to yourself to try the Matiz product."
2887,Neutral,Mistaken Order,"It was our mistake, but we thought we were purchasing the much better boneless/skinless club sardines from Seasons, which are very good.  These are not as good, although they are better than the cheaper branded sardines."
2888,Neutral,more oil and less fish,notice for the last 25 cans less fish and more oil to make up the ounce weight<br /><br />still tase good but noticeable difference
2889,Neutral,"convenient, low-acid, but a bit weak","The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again."
2890,Neutral,Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe,"While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee."
2891,Neutral,"Good, robust coffee","One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor."
2892,Neutral,This Coffee is Not Bad,"This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of ""pods"" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though."
2893,Neutral,Weak but okay,"Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper."
2894,Neutral,not for french roast coffee drinkers,"i drink my coffee strong and black so this is too weak for me.  i do have the one pot coffee maker and i either have to decrease the water or use two of these.  this is not economical.  it is much easier to just wrap some french roast coffee into a paper towel and use that instead.  if you like very mild coffee pods, this i s fine, but not for those of us who can't get it strong enough."
2895,Neutral,OK Coffee,"This is decent coffee. Nothing special. It is not very strong or distinctive. Does not have much ""jump."" Nothing wrong with it either, except for the fact that for a coffee product that prides itself on being environmentally sensitive, it is being sold in single pod packages that are anything but. Time to leave that sort of contradiction behind."
2896,Neutral,Ok but I've had better,Tasted my first 8 ounce cup with the usual amount of sugar. It's fair I guess for a medeum roast coffee but homestly I've had better & I won't be buying any after my 15 count pack runs out. Sorry this one's not a winner as the caffiene is on the weak side however the flavor seems to be good. Unless your not looking for that morning coffee wakeup then I'd pass on this one.
2897,Neutral,Weak coffee,"It's organic, arabica coffee packaged in pods. I was looking forward to great tasting, conveniently packaged coffee. The box contains 15 pods. Though there's plenty of organic ads and blurbs on the box, there was not one line of instruction. I followed the suggestion on the product page here, and used my drip coffee maker with 8oz of water. The coffee was way too weak. I think using half the water amount would work better."
2898,Neutral,"Good flavor, but weak","There's more about Bob Marley on these coffee packets than brewing instructions. There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.  But machine compatibility? Light/med/dark roast? Recommended cup size.  Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very ""Starbucks-y"" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.  Unless you're running a caf&eacute;."
2899,Neutral,"Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water","These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G"">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee."
2900,Neutral,"A Good company, but the coffee is a disappointment","I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0"">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW"">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good."
2901,Neutral,Not Quite Bold Enough,"I am not a coffee drinker, but my husband has a travel cup attached to his hand. This is his review:<br /><br />The coffee was okay. Very flavorful.<br />My preferred coffee flavor is bolder along the Italian/ Colombian lines so this having a subtle hint of flower flavor was very different.<br />I know this will be a big hit to some coffee drinkers but it is not for me."
2902,Neutral,For people who Like Weak Coffee,"I like my coffee strong so to me this tastes like strong tea that smells vaguely of coffee.  I prepared it the way you would tea--just put it in the cup and poured.  Maybe I should have done something differently but that's all we have (except a conventional coffee machine).  I tried squeezing it with my fingers and that helped a bit.  The only problem was that afterwards my fingers smelled like bitter coffee.  Squeezing the coffee bag with a spoon didn't produce quite the same result.<br /><br />So bottom line: if you like weak coffee, this is worth a try I think.  Otherwise, not so much."
2903,Neutral,Pod Brewing - Bleh;  LOOSE Brewing FANTASTIC,"I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea."
2904,Neutral,Flavorful but weak,"This coffee comes in individually foil-sealed pods. If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you."
2905,Neutral,Not Bad at All,"I've been brewing this in a proper pod brewing machine the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUWHM"">BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer</a>. Even in a 15 oz. mug these pods produce a good, not great, slightly bitter, strong cup of coffee. I don't know about 'exotic floral and berry notes' as the description states. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough. I just like a strong cup of black coffee and that's what I got. There wasn't anything really special or exciting about the One Love Organic Coffee but there also wasn't anything really bad about it either... I doubt I would get this again, there's better coffee out there."
2906,Neutral,One Love of the Smell of it!,"The name and packaging is what attracted me to it.<br /><br />The smell lured me in; I could sit forever in a coffee shop that smells like it.<br /><br />The struggle to open the outer wrap was frustrating.<br /><br />The brew itself, no matter how it's prepared is ok to good. It's not strong like Starbucks, nor mellow and smooth like Dunkin's. It is mild with no aftertaste. I am a long time coffee lover and drink it black.<br /><br />The choice is sustainably grown organic coffee or taste?  I'm going to mix it up!"
2907,Neutral,Not Quite Feeling the Love,"These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold."
2908,Neutral,"Dark Color, Watery Flavor","Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy."
2909,Neutral,not a fan,"I did not enjoy this coffee. This is more of that old world kind of beverage. You are drinking and feel transported 200 years ago, when they did not have keurig's and startbucks, if you know what I mean. It almost feels dusty. Not enough boldness, not enough flavor, not enough depth. Not for me."
2910,Neutral,"Unique flavors,  mediocre taste","We're a 2-3 cup a day coffee household.  This doesn't include all of the weekly trips to the coffee shop while at work for more specialized drinks.  Most of our home coffee is whole bean Colombian which we grind in a Krups espresso machine and coffee maker.  We're generally not terribly adventurous with our coffee choices so we were more than happy to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Organic and Fair Trade.<br /><br />+ Pleasant aromatic smell.<br /><br />+ Works great in a French Press.<br /><br />+ Great for travel.<br /><br />+ Appealing packaging and good overall message.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Tastes more like coffee flavored water than real coffee.<br /><br />- No instructions on or in the box on how to brew properly.<br /><br />- Improvisation may be necessary if you don't have a pod brewer.  We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.  As I mentioned earlier, the coffee taste was more like coffee flavored water than an actual brewed cup of coffee.  Despite the lack of taste, these pods are really handy if you travel or have a French Press at work.  If you're feeling adventurous or just want to support Organic and Fair Trade coffee growers then you may want to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try."
2911,Neutral,I Love The Message!,"I had never heard for Marley's Coffee before, so as the was reading all of the information on the box, the last thing I looked at was the top of the box, to find out that the Marley is as in Bob Marley!<br /><br />Upon first looking at the box, the first thing I noticed was how the perimeter of the box reminded me of Christmas, with the red, green and gold colors.<br /><br />I especially loved what I saw written on the back of the box.  It really seems to come from the heart.<br /><br />It says ""That pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial.  They know where their beans come from, and how they are grown.  The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness"".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. ""We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace"".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for."
2912,Neutral,In the Middle,"I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk. The flavor was mild, pleasant, but for me, the taste was too bland, did not stand out. Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore, not ultimately satisfying. I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite."
2913,Neutral,"Mild, Weak","Even though it says it's a medium roast, it's more mild and weak flavored. Would definitely have to use more pods to get better flavor. My son also tried it and used 2 pods for a 16 oz to go cup. He agreed it was weak but also commented that it had an odd flavor note to it."
2914,Neutral,Too Weak For My Taste,"I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though."
2915,Neutral,Inconsistent (was:Coffee for tea drinkers),"As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court"
2916,Neutral,WEAK,"I thought this might be a good back up for when I run out of Keurig cups, but I find it be really weak coffee. It doesnt really work that well in the coffee maker so I use it as a kind of teabag. But it's just not strong enough for me to purchase for coffee."
2917,Neutral,Surprisingly easy to make but lacking the bold flavor,"It's about time that coffee takes the road of tea and become more user friendly. The battle between pods/bags/filters has been firmly for filters in the past few years. Can this product sway the battle?<br /><br />Sadly, it only produces a mediocre cup of coffee. The 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, produced under free trade and in an organic environment, should have a bold robust flavor. Maybe it is the bags themselves or the beans but the flavor was thin enough to be overpowered by minimal amounts of sugar or milk.<br /><br />That being said, on the road, it's not a bad cup of joe. 4 stars for portability and ease of use."
2918,Neutral,Okay,"I didn't have the appropriate brewer, so I just had to steep it. That may have affected the taste some, but probably not. I was intrigued by the combination of coffee and tea, but it didn't meet my expectation. I prefer my coffee a lot stronger and richer. This was pretty weak. That may appeal to some people, though. What I do like about it is that it is organic and fair-trade."
2919,Neutral,"Ho, Hum","Conveniently single cup packaging, perfect for traveling, smells great when you unseal the foil packet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives. The down side is that the packaging is appropriate for 'pod' brewing only and ends up brewing a pretty weak cup of coffee at that (maybe I'm biased, since I tend to brew Gevalia Dark Roast at about 7-8 scoops per 12 cup pot). I think that, at best, this is an average cup of coffee. P-)"
2920,Neutral,Not quite strong enough,"I gave this product only three stars simply because the coffee was not quite strong enough for my taste.  My usual morning coffee consists of a stronger brew, and this particular product did not give me a strong enough coffee.  The coffee has a couple of redeeming qualities, first it is a fair trade coffee, which I really appreciate.  Secondly, the coffee comes in very convenient single serve packs, which make brewing coffee very simple and fast in the morning.  The single serve packs were also a disadvantage for the coffee because you could not adjust the brew strength of the coffee.  I found that when I made my coffee in the morning, using my normal proceedures that the coffee was not strong enough once I added the cream and sugar to the coffee.<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee was palatable, if you are a person that likes a light roast, or a light brew.  If that is the type of brew that you are after, this is an excellent coffee for you, personally however I found the coffee a bit too light for my taste."
2921,Neutral,"Good Coffee, But Not Great Coffee","I liked this coffee; it really has a good flavor. It's not the best possible coffee flavor, unless maybe you don't like a very intense, strong flavor. It's not as good as, say, Gevalia - if you like your coffee very flavorful. The proceeds do go to a good cause, though - helping children gain access to the positive influence of sports. If you happen to be a fan of this particular Ethiopian bean and you want to support the cause, then Marley Coffee is the coffee for you. Incidentally, the package design is gorgeous."
2922,Neutral,Decent flavor,"The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss."
2923,Neutral,"Great fragrance, disappointing when brewed","I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts."
2924,Neutral,Pretty good,"Aroma was awesome. As far as the taste goes, I definitely got the berry note. I was not as taken by the strength of the blend.  Mild to bland would be my comment there. All in all, it was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. From two to three stars based on the aromatherapy of the experience. Mild to non-existent aftertaste.<br /><br />That said, if you LIKE milder, blander coffees, this might fill the bill. I just expected a heartier coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
2925,Neutral,"Acceptable, but not fantastic","This coffee smelled great, but the taste was less impressive.  It wasn't that the coffee was too bitter or strong, it was that the taste was sort of blah.  There was nothing remarkable about the flavor, it really was quite boring, if one can call a coffee boring.  This coffee would do the job in the morning if I didn't have any better stuff to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.  It's just not very flavorful.  If it tasted like it smelled it would have been so much better."
2926,Neutral,we have 4 differnt coffee machines and this didn't fit any of them,We tried every which way to make this coffee. It is frustrating that each coffee must have it's own system to work. I gave up but not to worry I passed the coffee on to my sister. She was so pleased with the gift. She used a French press and said it worked fine for her. It was a full bodied coffee and good for that early morning wake up.
2927,Neutral,Not bad,"I must have somehow ""missed"" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there."
2928,Neutral,Pleasant but nothing to get excited about,"I love coffee and I start my day with it and I drink half a pot in the evenings too.  So I was excited to try this blend but it was not as exciting as the description on their website. The scent was fragrant and inviting but the taste fell flat. After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the ""floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish"" as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.  Try Komodo Dragon by Starbucks instead. Bob Marley needs to stick with his day job."
2929,Neutral,Bitter Brew,"I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.  The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with ""exotic floral and berry beans"" I can't really recommend it too much."
2930,Neutral,I Really Wanted to Like This,"I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them. This didn't affect my score.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get the right mix it is still organic, free trade coffee and I'll take it any day over the stuff from the big manufacturers. But I was hoping for an easier just-strong-enough experience."
2931,Neutral,"Weak, tho tasty","I read some of the other reviews here and decided to try putting a pod in my espresso machine. Worked fine, except the coffee was not very dark. Then I took the pod and dropped it into the coffee to make it darker. Still weak. This is the same problem I have with all the pod/cup/premeasured coffees. While I do know people who drink coffee brewed like this, it's not strong enough for my taste, and I think most people's. The flavor is good, would be delicious if strong, so maybe next time I will use two pods. However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied. It could be dried out from all the processing -- ground coffee should probably be stored in a packed brick, not individual, non-vacuum-packed packets. Oh well."
2932,Neutral,No Caffeine Boost,"Brewed my first cup this morning and was not impressed.  You can taste the blueberry, wine and chocolate characteristics, but this light roast coffee does not offer a ""first cup in the morning"" big caffeine boost.  Maybe if you are looking for a simple midday break you could brew a cup, but do not look for any pick me up qualities, this brew is designed for a pairing with a fruit based snack.  So, if you are looking for a paring with you afternoon muffin, this pod might work for you."
2933,Neutral,Bland Marley.,"To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again."
2934,Neutral,"Coffee's delicious, but not the easiest to brew.","Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.  But yeah: seriously tasty coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee-ness in your hot water."
2935,Neutral,This is not the way to make a cup of coffee,"There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product."
2936,Neutral,Not that great,"I found that the pod made a very weak and not very flavorful cup of coffee. I didn't think it had much of an aroma either. Sadly, I would only consider this adequate coffee in a total coffee emergency. I prefer medium to dark roasts, and this just didn't have a good flavor. If you like very mild coffee, you might like this."
2937,Neutral,Failed to blow me away,I love good coffee with rich flavor that doesn't hint of burnt beans. This coffee delivered in that it had an OK flavor without tasting burnt but a felt it was a little more acidic then I prefer. It wasn't a super smooth coffee but it wasn't bad for a quick cup. I don't think I'll be getting this again as I do prefer to grind my own beans but it was a nice change.
2938,Neutral,Decent but Not Particularly Strong Coffee,"The first thing you will notice with Marley Coffee is it smells really good.  Unfortunately once you brew it is not as strong as I would like it, but still a serviceable coffee.  These are single pod coffee packages, individually wrapped to keep them fresh until you use them with fifteen per box.  And even though it does not mean anything for the overall taste, the packaging is attractive with a slit you can make at the bottom of the box to remove the pods (or just open the top normally is you like).  Just do not ask me what it has to do with Bob Marley."
2939,Neutral,Decent coffee,"As the description says: this is for single-serve ""pod"" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee. Keep that in mind...<br /><br />Now, to the coffee: it was good in a 6-8oz brew, with the flavors being pretty much as described. However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less."
2940,Neutral,"Yeah, I can't use these...","Receiving coffee pods was a first for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with these.  I don't have a pod coffee machine and so I initially thought that I could use these pods much like you would a tea bag.  I steeped it in my boiling water and then smelled the rich aroma and gulped down murky flavored fiery hot water.  It was bland and unappealing.  I've read that you can empty the contents into a conventional coffee machine and use it that way, but it would take a lot of pods to equal out a pot of coffee, and I don't have a conventional coffee maker so that wouldn't help me much.  I actually snatched this up because I thought I could make this like tea, and I wouldn't need a coffee maker.  It smells amazing, but like some other reviewers here, the pod process is a bit of a stumbling block.  I know that they make coffee makers specifically for these pods, but I can't see myself rushing out to buy one.  Just be aware before you buy that this may not be what you are bargaining for.  I do use these pods though, in my cooking.  They serve as a wonderful way to flavor stock and I'll simmer them when preparing different meat dishes.  Coffee is a great flavoring tool, and so I actually like these pods for that.  I recently cut one of these pods open and crusted pork with the contents.  It was wonderful."
2941,Neutral,"Smells nice, but weak coffee flavor","I got this because I was looking for a great coffee to make at work without a coffee machine or spending $2 on a cup.  Unfortunately I will have to keep searching.<br /><br />This smells really nice, but is very weak coffee."
2942,Neutral,Decent coffe but not for the stronger coffee lovers.,"This coffee brewed up nicely.  However I love a nice strong cup and found this coffee too weak for me.  If you are looking for a midrange coffee, I would recommend trying this.  By if you are like me and need something stronger, this coffee is not for you."
2943,Neutral,"OK Coffee - Wasteful, Escessive Packaging","I found the coffee in a single serving pod to be pretty weak for an 8 oz cup.  Since I don't have this style of coffee maker, I opened the pods and poured them directly into the coffee filters I normally use to make coffee.  Two packages makes a pretty tasty, full bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this product was the incredible amount of packaging for very little product.  15 small pouches of coffee, wrapped up like tea bags, each one individually packaged in a foil packet which are all placed in a fairly large box.  The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of ""fair trade,"" ""ethical treatment of farm workers,"" ""biodiversity"" and ""sustainable cultivation"" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it's hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company's declaration of ""we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial,"" sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.  How pure can it really be after it has gone through this much processing?"
2944,Neutral,Just not that good,"I shared this with a group of my coworkers. We all tried it and though we all thought it was okay taste and ease of use wise, none of us were really that sold on the taste. Either it became way too watery, or when it was strong it just did not taste very good."
2945,Neutral,"Good coffee, but needs to be made strong","Like many others, I don't actually have a pod coffee machine. I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CVEH6"">Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer</a>. The first cup of coffee I made with this was very weak. By dropping the bag directly into the coffee and swishing it around tea bag style, I was able to get a stronger flavor. For my second cup, I just cut open the pod, dumped in the grounds and only let it drip until the color started to lighten. That made for a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Marley One Love coffee is an Ethipian Yirgacheffe, which is supposed to be a pretty reputable bean, and it delivers a good coffee. Properly prepared, it is full bodied, with only a slight hint of bitterness - much better than some other highly recommended coffees that I've tried. And the amount of coffee in the packet is just right for a strong standard cup of coffee if you prepare it right - only dripping through until the drip starts to get light. However, it sounds like some people using standard pod coffee makers are getting week coffee and my experience with my first cup indicates the water goes through the pod casing too fast, not giving the grounds a chance to get truly wet so that the water drips through them too quickly and doesn't carry enough of the flavor. So I would say that there's good coffee inside but maybe the delivery process needs work.<br /><br />If you're using a proper pod coffee maker, you're on your own. But if you're looking for something better than the office brew, the contents of the 67 cent pouch are great for using in other single cup setups. 4 stars for the coffee, but 1 star off since it sounds like my roundabout way of making a cup gets better results than the easy way the pod is supposed to provide for."
2946,Neutral,"Okay, for a not very strong coffee","I like my coffee kind of medium, not too strong, not too weak, and these pods made fairly weak coffee.  I compare them to my own home made pods (using the ""Ecopad""  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007INM5A/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details) which I use in my Senseo, and I was fairly disappointed.  It was easy to see that the Marley Coffee Pods made much weaker coffee (lighter color, almost watery appearance).  I think I will stick with my Ecopad coffee pods.<br /><br />Incidentally, I want to put in a good word here for the Senseo coffee maker.  It is great for making a single cup of coffee (or maybe even a few cups of coffee but not at the same time).  The Ecopad pods are just as economical as regular coffee (you just spoon ground coffee into the Ecopad and make coffee as usual)."
2947,Neutral,"OK coffee, but there are better alternatives","I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K"">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find ""burnt"", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G"">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars."
2948,Neutral,"Good coffee, but no directions for use or preparation.","I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty."
2949,Neutral,A Safe coffee that won't offend anyone,"Comes in round, flat, pods so beware before purchasing. I just dropped one in the filter holder of my regular coffee maker used about 1 cup of water and it worked out OK. There are no instructions on the box on what to do with the pods, how much water or what machines it might work with.<br /><br />Evaluation:<br />Comes in single serving pods.<br />Nice packaging.<br />Light to medium strength coffee.<br />Tastes very slightly burnt.<br />Unlike what the advertising says, I taste no ""berry notes"".<br />No acidic taste (a plus).<br />Organic<br />Fair trade certified means farmers are paid a fair price for their coffee beans.<br /><br />In my opinion, there's better coffee out there, but worth a try. This coffee is fine for the average coffee drinker. It's not bold enough for the purist, but won't offend them either."
2950,Neutral,Nice coffee but a little acid,"It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the ""tea-bagging"" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a ""coffee-flavored water"" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods."
2951,Neutral,Not bad,"Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product."
2952,Neutral,"Great Concept, But Where Are the Directions?","There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great."
2953,Neutral,No pizzazz!,"After finding the right way to brew this coffee - as strong as I like it - , I realized that there was nothing extraordinary about the flavor.  It's not completely bland, it just doesn't have anything special that would make me want to buy it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Organic<br />- Part of the money goes to a good cause<br />Cons:<br />- Nothing special in the type of roast.<br />- Too high price.<br /><br />I'd rather stick to other brands that I like better than buy Marley coffee."
2954,Neutral,Not really a medium roast,"This coffee is really more a light roast and I prefer at least a medium roast.  It does have good flavor and aroma, just more on the light roast side."
2955,Neutral,Too expensive for me!,"I like Diamond walnuts, and buy them regularly---the online price is just too high! I'm on a tight budget, and can buy a 16 oz bag at a local grocery store like walmart, kroger, etc--for less than $9.00 a bag. Why would I pay more?"
2956,Neutral,Shipping/packaging problem,The nuts arrived. I don't know how. The box was completely open at the top and the bottom was falling apart. The box was damp and it looked like the tape which was to hold the two panels of the top had not been put on very well. I'm not sure if tis review is going to reach anyone. I tried to find a site I could click on to make this comment but was not successful.
2957,Neutral,bait and switch,"We subscribed to the diamond walnut offer December of 2010.  Price was very reasonable (About $4.00 per bag w/ free shipping)  Got our first shipment as promised.  Everything was just as they said.  AS it got closer to the time to get our next shipment, Amazon sent us an e-mail reminding us that if we wanted to change the frequency, we could do that. Since we still had (3) bags left, I decided to bump the order back a few weeks.  I noticed when I got the delivery confirmation, the price had jumped to over $6.00 per bag.  Now I understand food prices do rise and fall on occassion but to jump that much in less than a month, was very fishy. I felt like they had done a bait and switch on the pricing.  Good product if you're willing to spend the  money."
2958,Neutral,Berres Brothers Coffee,"Even though I had a read a previous review on this coffee stating that the customer did not receive the exact coffee that was being offered, I took a chance that I would receive what was being sold.  I too, did not receive a ""Columbian Supremo"" Coffee, but chose not to return the item.  The coffee was exceptable but I would probably not order it again."
2959,Neutral,disappointed,this item displayed is not what the customer receives. My recent purchases of the item displayed where shipped as Berres Brothers Coffee Colombian not the Supremo. There is a differance. I was refunded my money spent however. I wanted the Supremo which is what I drink from them.
2960,Neutral,Mango's had a kindof strange taste,"They weren't rotten or bad, they just didn't taste like Mango's, more like a babyfood taste"
2961,Neutral,Too dirty,"The Original Dirty Sue Dirty Martini Mix was o.k., but just a bit ""too"" dirty, for my taste. In order for the martini to be more to my liking, more vodka had to be added. After two martinis, I was blitzed or well on my way!<br />When following the directions,on the bottle, for mixing a martini it tasted as if it was totally olive brine.<br />The mix will suffice ""in a pinch""."
2962,Neutral,A little disappointed,"I was so excited to finally have olive juice without the olives.  I can clear out the back of the fridge and all those dessicated olives.  I had read wonderful reviews of Dirty Sue's and was pleased to see I could get it through Amazon and not pay the expensive shipping from the dirty sue website.  So yippee, I went ahead and bought the 4 pack.  Now I probably have three more bottles than I care to have.<br /><br />Its not that its bad.  Its just not what I've come accustomed to when adding olive juice to my martini from the Goya olive jar.  The dirty sue is a subtler flavor and lacks the zest and salt of the juice from the jar.<br /><br />If you're expecting it to be the same as what you've been having from your olives but without the olives, than think twice before ordering all 4 bottles."
2963,Neutral,Serves the purpose,If you're a fan of dirty martinis heavy on the dirty then this fills a need.<br />I've had better olive juice and some worse.
2964,Neutral,"not bad, but not a must for a dirty martini","was also always running out of the juice from my jars of olives like most other dirty martini drinkers here.  purchased 4 bottles about a month ago, still, the first bottle is there half way left.  one thing is pretty clear- now that i have the olive juice home, i am starting to run out of olives- so if you still need to buy a jar of olives for a dirty martini, why bother to buy the juice on its own?"
2965,Neutral,"Ok, but will look for something better","This popping corn is a mix of pros and cons for us.  It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.  For the cost, that's too much.  We'll be trying something else next time."
2966,Neutral,It's OK,"This popcorn pops well, minimal old maids, we have an electric popper. However it's a little bland, had to use more butter/salt than what we use with our standard popcorn."
2967,Neutral,"Seems average in taste, possibly not compatible with all hot air poppers","I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper. I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter, if your hot air popper has a lot of power, be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop. The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly, I  do not find the popcorn fluffier or less ""husky"". In fact, I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper. It is nice to know the corn is organic, but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply! ;)"
2968,Neutral,Not too bad,"These are sort of like brownies.  A little soft, a little dry.  My 7 year old really likes them.  They're good if you are on a restricted diet, but otherwise nothing too special."
2969,Neutral,Disappointed in texture,"It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...<br />As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the ""crunch"", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldn't have bought a whole box full."
2970,Neutral,"Moderately tasty, gluten free","Our family has members who keep kosher, who are vegetarians, who are unable to eat gluten, etc.  This cookie covers all the bases, but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty.  However, they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust, which is a great feature.  I have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better.<br /><br />Really, though, how good can a gluten free cookie be?"
2971,Neutral,"Good, but not the best of the Nana's varieties","I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around."
2972,Neutral,Ingredients are not up to date!,"In the past I have purchased these cookie bars through Amazon and have had good business. However, Amazon has not kept up with the ingredients changing in these cookie bars. It is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods I purchase. I am not happy with Amazon's business this time. Ingredients change often! Amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website."
2973,Neutral,"It is alright, depends on your taste",I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a small drink!
2974,Neutral,Tea Forte Petite Herbal Retreat,The box is beautiful and the tea looks great but I did not like any of the flavors.  I am a green tea drinker daily and I sometimes enjoy flavored tea.  I think all the flavors had an artificial flavor.  Maybe they would taste better brewed and served cold.
2975,Neutral,Very tasty for people who LOVE black pepper,"This is a good salami, especially as part of an antipasto. I slice this and serve it with mozzarella, stuffed green olives, and sliced plum tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It's a great hit and the heavy pepper matches well with the more subtle mozzarella."
2976,Neutral,Could be better...,"These bars are an excellent source of fiber and a very convenient way to fit more into your diet.  At 12 grams of fiber per bar, just one bar will put you well on your way to meeting the daily suggested amount.  However, the taste isn't that great.  They are dry and very dense.  I wouldn't mind the heaviness of the bar, if the manufacturer could find a way to make these a little more moist.  I felt like I needed a whole glass of milk to go with it just to be able to chew and swallow.  My taste buds didn't detect much of a chocolate taste either.  I think that the Banana Walnut and Apple Cinnamon cereal bars, while also dry, have a better flavor than the Brownie bar."
2977,Neutral,Just shampoo... nothing special.,"I bought this shampoo for my 12-year old dog who has started to have sensitive skin issues. It's really nothing special. Just light color, light fragrance.  I didn't see anything special about it compared to any other sensitive skin/oatmeal shampoo."
2978,Neutral,"Good coffee, good price","I don't normally drink strong coffee, so this variety was good for me. Good flavor, but not too strong or bitter. The only down side is that several k-cups (probably 6 or 7 out of the first 2/3 of the box) failed and left an excessive amount of grounds in the brewed coffee. If not for that, it would be 4 stars.<br /><br />At the price I paid ($27.75) it is a pretty good value as well."
2979,Neutral,Timothy's Breakfast Blend,"This was my first order of this product.<br /><br />I found the blend a little weaker than expected but, I would order again if on sale."
2980,Neutral,No longer available,"This coffee was very good, but the coffee maker, IMO, is expensive to use so I stopped ordering this product and I'm going back to my regular coffee maker.  I was also told this product is no longer available here."
2981,Neutral,It's just OK,"This Breakfast Blend is just OK!!  I have been trying to find a K-cup that I really really enjoy.  I'll just have to keep trying.  However, I truly appreciate Amazon's Terrific Service...  Thanks Amazon ~ Keep  up your GOOD WORK!!!"
2982,Neutral,"Good Flavor, but bad batches","I like the flavor of this coffee, but the last couple orders have had significant issues with the cups not brewing correctly and are plugged up.  I have a machine at home and at work and this batch does the same thing in both machines.  Over 1/2 of the cups in the box are defective."
2983,Neutral,You may like CP Donut Shop better,"I have tried this Breakfast Blend several times. If you need a morning jolt it may be too weak for you, but it may be good if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />*** FYI, If you don't like any flavor k-cups, you can trade them for ones that you do like at the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo. No one tries to sell ya anything in the group and its totally free.  Here's the address [...]"
2984,Neutral,Timothy's Breakfast Blend,"I purchased the Timothy's ""Breakfast Blend"" k-cups for my wife.  ""Breakfast blend"" is her favorite coffee choice, one of the coffee selections her employer supplies for their Keurig brewers.  She does not judge the taste of the Timothy's brand as good as the Green Mountain brand provided by her employer.  Having tried both, I concur.  The taste is not bad - just not as good.  However, the price per k-cup for the Timothy's brand is attractive.  For us, this is a case of one gets what one pays for."
2985,Neutral,It was ok,At first I thought I liked it but then I got a funny taste to it. I only had one to try so maybe the second time around it would have been better. I do love the kona blend by Tully. Yum!
2986,Neutral,eh...,not bad... but there are better ones (like kona!).  would pass on this on just because there are better tasting ones in this price range.
2987,Neutral,Good coffee but faulty packaging.,"Makes a nice cup of coffee. Nothing outstanding, just a nice cup of coffee.<br />However, we're having a lot of the K-cups mess up with this product. The foil comes loose from the cup and causes the grounds to squirt out the opening. This leaves you with a coffee maker to clean up and grounds in your coffee.<br />Thinner foil covering or better sealing is needed before we would buy this product again."
2988,Neutral,Good coffee but bad packaging,I recd. Timothy's French Vanilla decaf and couldn't wait to try it.  The first one out of the box and 50% or more of the rest of them blew up while brewing leaving a heck of a mess.  What a nuisance to have to clean up a mess like that every time you want a cup of coffee not to mention grounds in the coffee.  Not sure if I'll take a chance on Timothy's again.
2989,Neutral,"Product good, don't use Subscribe and Save","Product is good but if you get suckered into the subscribe and save like I did, they will increase the price by $5 without notifying you and charge you when they automatically ship the next order.  Very bad business...I won't order from them again."
2990,Neutral,Timothy's K-Cups are Always Good,"We prefer 100% Columbian, and though this breakfast blend is good, it is not one we will reorder."
2991,Neutral,A bit bland for my taste,This morning blend is average flavor coffee.  Nothing special about it.  I went through a box but decided to go back to a more bold blend of coffee.
2992,Neutral,Knock off version of Timothy's,"Does anyone realize that this coffee is not from THE REAL Timothy's? I have purchased Timothy's from Keurig and now have purchased it from Amazon and the packaging is different. It looks like they have knocked off the packaging. It is close put there are definitely differences which makes me wonder about how safe this coffee actually is to drink. I ordered the Breakfast Blend and the Pumpkin-which tastes fine but I am just a little leery. I think I will call Amazon to find out what is going on. If anyone has any thoughts, please let me know. Thanks."
2993,Neutral,Bitter to the last drop.,"Since I like dark, full bodied coffees, I thought ""Jet Fuel"" would be right up there.  While it is a dark roast, I think the roasters went a bit tooo far, as I find this blend bitter and acidic.  I'll finish the box, but I probably won't reorder since there are just too many good coffees out there."
2994,Neutral,good but now too expensive,"Was a good deal when selling the 50 count for $22 (less than 50 cents per cup). However, at $27+ it's no longer worth buying from Amazon.  Can get the same deal at the grocery stores when buying an 18 count box for $10 and can even get the Green Mountain brand for that price. Good coffee though and I considered setting up the automatically times shipment to my house every month, however until it drops down to below 50 cents per cup, I won't."
2995,Neutral,"Really, no packaging??????","We purchase K-cups from Amazon on a regular basis.  I buy for my family as well as my parents.  We have always been 100% satisfied.<br /><br />First of all, it took a while for us to get our coffee.  We ordered the TW Breakfast Blend as well as some decaf from a different coffee company.  The decaf showed up right away, no problem as usual.  A week later when our TW Breakfast Blend showed up, I opened the cardboard packing box to find 50 k-cups.  That's it, just the K-cups, no packaging, wrapping or anything.  Usually you get 2 boxes of 25 or whatever.  We open one box and put the other away for storage.  Okay, so now I have no place to store this lovely brown packaging box with my 50 loose k-cups.<br /><br />I know it sounds petty but it was just weird.  I was even nervous using them as I was wondering if they were safe????  Coffee is fine, but I've never purchased something, especially a consumable, that wasn't professionally packaged."
2996,Neutral,Ok but not my favorite. Good to have when you need to surve a variety of tastes in a hurry,"My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups.  K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgagn Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Of the three manufacturer's I have tried, Timothy's was my least favorite because it was the weakest. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review"
2997,Neutral,Getting way toooo expen$ive,This coffee is OK.  Price has been continually going up.  For what it costs it should be outstanding coffee.Is this twenty words yet?
2998,Neutral,Most of the crackers in the boxes were in pieces...,"I ordered this product through Amazon and found that most of the crackers were broken up into pieces.  I don't know if this was because of poor handling during shipping or just a faulty batch.  The flavor was good although it got old after a couple boxes, but flavor is a subjective thing so you may or may not like it.  Another thing to note is that these are the 9 oz boxes, which are smaller than the normal box you are used to seeing.  I didn't notice that when ordering, so I thought I was getting a better deal than I actually was."
2999,Neutral,Buyer Beware - Jars break in transit!,"My daughter loves Earth's Best food items but after two broken shipments from Amazon, I decided to buy from the grocery store.  I sent an email to Amazon but my issue was never resolved."
3000,Neutral,Pricey...,My son loves all the food by earths best but would like to mention that it's way cheaper buying in store than amazon. Amazon charges 2 - 3$ more than stores.
3001,Neutral,IMO not as good as Country Choice,I bought these because someone said they were better than Country Choice.  To me they are not as tasty and have less texture.  But the price seems better.  I don't think I will ever finish them even though I eat oatmeal almost every day.
3002,Neutral,very convenient to have if you're on the road.,"I really liked how convenient they were. What I didn't like is how concentrated it was, but maybe it was just me. My baby would get very constipated. That is the only reason I didn't like it too much. I only used it if it was an emergency."
3003,Neutral,"Not bad, quick and easy to fix","I could eat this Vegan Split Pea Soup and be fairly well satisfied. It's tasty enough and easy to prepare. Of course it doesn't come close to my homemade pea soup but when there's no time to cook up a batch of the regular soup, then this is nice to keep on hand. It has a good texture and is filling."
3004,Neutral,Very Bland!,"Nothing really wrong with it, and it certainly appears to be healthy.  Maybe I was expecting too much from a powdered soup mix, although I have purchased tastier split pea soups here on Amazon.  Don't know much about vegans (and don't really care to).  Maybe they like and expect their food to be bland.  But if you'd like some substantial taste, look elsewhere."
3005,Neutral,A Healthier Choice than Regular Soda,"I was a little skeptical at first when I got these for my kids, but I came away impressed.  They loved the taste of the grapefruit, apple, & pomegranate flavors, and I felt good that with fruit juice and added vitamins Izze is healthier than regular soda.  Downsides: they are still concentrated simple carbs, there are some health concerns regarding the health effects of carbonated beverages, and the premium price."
3006,Neutral,Metal Taste From Cans! Manufactured by PEPSI,"This was a split in the family - my husband and son did not notice a metal taste - but my daughter and I could taste it overwhelmingly! I drink Poland Spring Seltzer lemon flavor etc... from cans so that isn't the issue.  I've had this same soda in bottles and love the taste - especially the grapefruit!  This has much less sugar than regular soda and is organic.  But, did you know it is made by PEPSI??  I didn't until I wrote to the company online to tell them about the metal taste and received an email back from PEPSI. It is a tad deceiving for the IZZE company to claim to be its own entity when it is owned and operated by PEPSI.  Maybe it is like many of these organic companies who were bought out by the big giants - unable to make it on their own...<br />But, the metal taste was so bad we were unable to drink ANY of them!"
3007,Neutral,"4 star product, 2 star packaging","The product itself has been reviewed sufficiently already - it's tasty enough and a bit healthier than soda. It also lacks those nasty preservatives.<br /><br />The problem with buying this product from Amazon is the way Amazon delivers it. My 24 pack was delivered in a regular cardboard box. The Izze packaging is just a flimsy cardboard tray with plastic wrap covering the cans. The wrap doesn't cover the cans very well and isn't particularly snug. Since Amazon does pack this into a regular cardboard box for you, you won't need to worry about losing any of the cans in transit - but they will be clanking around in the box when it arrives on your doorstep. Open them slowly. If the Amazon box was smaller, this wouldn't happen."
3008,Neutral,"Better Than Soda Pop, Not as Great as Water","These little cans of Izze sparkling grapefruit juices went into a big ice chest for a recent party, and I was stunned to see how popular they were among the tween-aged kids. Parents had no objections to the caffeine- and processed-sugar-free drinks, and they taste refreshing and crisp.<br /><br />That said, nothing beats water if you really want to have the perfect health drink. And I was frustrated to have chosen grapefruit flavor, which I had forgotten was off-limits to a family member because of medication restrictions. For those who want soda or energy drink, this won't be a replacement, in spite of those who would call it a healthy soda.<br /><br />Overall, however, these sparkling juices are a great summer choice. Refreshing, relatively healthy and super popular from kids to adults -- we'll be adding them to our future shopping lists for sure."
3009,Neutral,Syrupy taste - but filling,"The main virtue these bars have is that they are useful snacks that don't tempt me to eat them up when I don't need them.  Bites with dried cranberries (maybe 3 to a bar) in them taste good enough - otherwise they taste like puffed rice drowned in syrup, which is pretty much what they are.  I prefer almost any of the other gluten-free bars I've tried - Gluten-Free Cafe lemon sesame bars, Larabars (all of them - especially apple pie), Kind fruit and nut bars, etc.  But these aren't terrible - and unlike the other bars named, they don't tempt me to snack on them when I'm at home and other food is available, which means I have them available for road trips when I need them."
3010,Neutral,Loaded with Goodness,"These bars hold together better and are loaded with healthy ingredients,very filling.  They are a better texture than some of the other granola bar flavors, but I could do without the ""syrupy"" taste."
3011,Neutral,Nothing special.  In between great and awful.,"Mmmm, it's the time of year when I remember how yummy pumpkin tastes.  So when I saw this Pumpkin Bread kit on sale I decided to give it a shot.  The recipe was super easy.  Add a few eggs, oil, and water to the canned pumpkin and then add their prepackaged dry ingredients.  I baked mine in a bundt pan (baking directions are on the package.)  The mixture provided too much batter for the bundt pan.  And even taking some out made for an overflowed baked product.  The final product tasted fine.  The texture was a bit chewier than expected.  And the spice level was a little muted.  I'm sure you could do better if you made it from scratch.  But do you really want to do that?<br /><br />The box shows you can also make muffins, so I'll try that next time.  I bet you can spruce these up with a little spice, and maybe jazz up the icing with some cream cheese."
3012,Neutral,stop smoking helper,I was looking for a sugar  free lollipop since I've stop smoking and tried these.  They have great  flavor but really thin which they were a little thicker so they lasted longer
3013,Neutral,A-OK,"The product didn't arrive in the packaging pictured in the description, but that's neither here nor there to me. I actually think I may have gotten more catnip in my bag, than in the one shown.<br /><br />My cat was never really very sensitive to catnip, and he always seemed like he could take it or leave it. I was hoping this would inspire the zen-like rolling and blissed-out scampering that I've seen my other cats enjoy in the past. I don't think it was the product's fault that this in fact, did not happen. I think I just have a cat that cat nip has a negligible effect on."
3014,Neutral,Shampoo... (?!),"I was so excited to have found the Confetti Angel Food Cake Mix here at Amazon as they don't sell it in the stores here --Until I discovered that included in the list of ingredients is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (just like in most shampoo)! I guess it's the 'fluffing agent.'  On the plain white Angel Food Cake Mix, they call it 'Sodium Lauryl Flavor.' If you aren't familiar with this additive, you might want to Google 'Sodium Lauryl Sulfate' before deciding if you would really want to eat this or not..."
3015,Neutral,"Okay, but expensive!","I thought I was buying this in lbs, not ounces.  It is a very small bag and very expensive!  Too expensive to make this my cats dry food choice.  The cats liked it okay, but they weren't in love with it, so I didn't purchase again."
3016,Neutral,Not minced,"I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money."
3017,Neutral,Quanty????,"This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info."
3018,Neutral,BUY THIS AT COSTCO,This is my go to drink - but you can buy a 24 pack at costco for about HALF the price listed here.
3019,Neutral,Loacker Quadratini Hazelnut Wafers,"I have to say I was looking forward to getting my favorite cookie, without paying the local $4.89 per package.  I always buy from Amazon whenever the price is right, and they have what I want.  The packages of wafers came as expected, however when I got them, one package had it's seam split and wafers throughout the box and they were less then fresh.  The other packages appeared to have gotten excessively warm as the wafers had slid off of each other, causing a ""slanted' wafer.  Not the upright wafer cookie I expected.  All in all, I will take a second look before I buy eatable items from Amazon."
3020,Neutral,NIce but not what I wanted,"I enjoyed the bars but probably won't ever buy them again.  I was looking for an organic chocolate bar with rice crisp.  This is more like a candy bar, very soft and more processed if that is the right word.  Organic rice crisp chocolate bars are not easy to find, alas."
3021,Neutral,"Disappointed the oil didn't come in a ""jar"" ended up being a ""plastic bottle.""  :(","Everything about the oil is amazing the way its processed, you would think they know what a quality product they have...until it came in a plastic bottle. When in the picture you can see its glass and its referred to as a jar (kind of important)!"
3022,Neutral,Pretty Good,"This a pretty good oil. Tastes good, nice texture, smells fresh. I've just experienced superior coconut by other brands. I like nutiva though, they carry quality products, so im not dissapointed, just not blown away. I'd probably re purchase eventually."
3023,Neutral,Great multi-use product,"I have purchased this exact product elsewhere & have yet to find this great of a deal! Nutiva tastes & smells amazing!! I truly appreciate the option to ""auto ship"" too. I use this oil from cooking, to hair care, to skin care...love it!"
3024,Neutral,I dont know how to buy coconut oil,Ok this coconut oil smells like alot of butter than coconut oil. I was expecting a fresh coconut oil smell like a tropical island smell this is not it. My mother and my sister do not like the smell at all but coconut oil is suppose to be really good on your body and I would really like to use it but I cant stand the smell. Did I get a bad batch because everyone on here thinks its smells sooooooooooooo good Im not gettting that at all..... is there any other brand?
3025,Neutral,"Stopped Using It Internally Some Time Ago, But Going to Try It Again","I used this for many months a few years ago. By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things."
3026,Neutral,Interesting stuff,"Rather bland tasting, although I havent tried to use it in some of the suggested ways. For a cooking oil it probably is OK. But it is expensive, so I don't think I'll buy it again.<br />The shipping was fast and I'll always buy other products from Amazon due to excellent service and prices."
3027,Neutral,haven't decided if it is wowrth it,"I received the product without incident.  I just am not convinced that it is with any merit.  I don't feel any different, my sugar levels remain the same.  I guess time will tell.  I don't think i would recommend purchasing this product."
3028,Neutral,Tastes great; is it really healthy?,"Love the taste, great for stir frys as well as a great additive to smoothies. I'm in two minds over the health issue though; searching medical journals only seems to show a vast majority of negative results (this stuff *is* mostly saturated fat after all) with a huge number of hits on sites which frankly sell this stuff. I don't know but I felt the need to balance all the glowlingly positive reviews...they jury is still out on whether this stuff really is good for you (hydrogenated coconut oil certainly isn't...this stuff is hopefully different)"
3029,Neutral,Tastes good!  Is it good for you???,"This coconut oil tastes good so I'm taking it!  But as to the health benefits, I don't know!  Who knows, for sure?"
3030,Neutral,Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil - IF NOT BLOOD TYPE O,"Actually, I'm more disappointed with my research into unrefined coconut oil than this product.  Through my internet research, I was assured that this product would take care of my cholesterol.  After eating 3 tablespoons every day for a couple of weeks, I noticed that I was becoming very lethargic and I started to have chest constrictions.  I was also giving a spoonful to my 4 year old daughter.  When I saw my daughter start acting dumb, it confirmed that my lethargy wasn't accidental.  I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat.  I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time.  She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise.  My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil.  We only use it to moisterize dry skin.<br /><br />Right after I doubted the effects of this product on cholesterol, I did a more thorough internet search and discovered that blood types O did not do well with coconut oil and it is best to avoid it.  Guess what.  One third the population in America, including my family, has blood type O.<br /><br />So coconut oil may help - if you don't have blood type O."
3031,Neutral,Coconut Oil,This product is supposed to be very good for you. But you need to make sure that you like coconut flavor...because it will add a little coconut flavor to your food. It is a little annoying that you have to melt the oil everytime you want to use it. But if you want the health benefits it is worth it. I haven't used it long enough to recognize any changes or benefits in my health.
3032,Neutral,"I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications","I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable.  Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated.  Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve.  I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up."
3033,Neutral,Coconut taste too pronounced,"I prefer the Spectrum coconut oils. Because they are flavorless, they have more potential uses."
3034,Neutral,Its ok,"Tastes fine, i didn't really notice any difference when taking it but i'm sure it is probably healthy.  I don't notice a difference when i take a multivitamin."
3035,Neutral,Nothing earth-shattering to report.,"This is by far, the worst smelling, worst tasting supplement known to man.  It is so far worse than anything GNC sells.  I can't believe that people would mix this with a smoothie. I mix 3 tablespoons with about 3oz of water and down it while holding my breath and immediately chase it with something like orange juice.  Does it work?  I have no idea.  Tough to tell.  I'll give it another month and see.  The price is right though, to at least try it out. I won't buy another bag of this foul powder though, I'll try the pills...."
3036,Neutral,Maca Powder - Navititas naturals,This is something I've wanted to try.  It's OK but not a favorite.  Can't compare to other brands as I have only tried this one.
3037,Neutral,the taste leaves little to be desired,"I got my MACA powder about 2 wks ago and I was excited since I had heard so many good things about it. However, I have to say the taste and smell has made me very nauseous. I just tried mixing it with soy milk and it was just too much for me. I only mixed about a tsp into 10oz of soymilk. I could taste it and smell it at every gulp. I don't know if these reviewers got a different batch than I have but it definitely smells HORRIBLE. Like I want to throw up every time it passes under my nose. Since I am a college student, I just can't waste the entire thing like that. So I decided to make my own capsules. I feel like I can definitely make more than 300 veggie capsules with this bag. I have no problem drinking 6 capsules to drinking this raw MACA. Plus making my own capsules will probably end up cheaper than buying the capsules from another company. Then at least you know exactly what is going in it and you can buy another powder and mix that into the capsule too. And I would buy it again for that reason.<br /><br />Definitely an acquired taste."
3038,Neutral,"Priced better then pills, tastes terrible","Although it is cheaper to buy then the pills it tasted terrible even mixed in a shake. I haven't noticed any real change in energy but it has been cleaning my colon out, although I am not sure that is a good thing."
3039,Neutral,do research first,"before you buy this, make sure you do your research first.  it may be potent- good and bad for you."
3040,Neutral,Decent product; not tasty,"I used a teaspoon of this powder, mixed with my protein powder to make my morning shakes. The taste and smell of this product is not great.  This is why I mix it with chocolate flavored protein powder, cinnamon, soy milk or regular fat free milk. It has a musty, burlap sack tasting kind of scent.  Adding stevia or splenda to my shake helped improved the taste, however, the odor was still there. I noticed after about a week of adding this product to my diet that I felt a little more alert mentally and energetic after drinking it.  Not in a way that caffeine affects me, but in a positive way it helped me get my work done with less brain fog. My skin looked clearer and brighter without makeup on. It had zero affect on my libido. Some users mention its helpful for that, but it did not do so for me. I am not sure I will buy the product again since I know so little about it's benefits. After all, I can just take a super B complex vitamin and feel the same response, no?  But really, the problem with me is the taste.  I plan to finish the bag to see it's longer term affects  and see if they outweigh the bad taste."
3041,Neutral,Meh,"These are ok as far as peanuts go, there is nothing special about them that should make you purchase them over local store bought peanuts, certainly not the price.... Also, the description says ""Salty snack, good source of protein, naturally nutritious"", these are unsalted."
3042,Neutral,feel better,It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner
